In a few weeks, the desks will be occupied by the 88 deputies of the Constituent Assembly who were elected Sunday. They will work on a new constitution, Guatemala's fifth in 40 years, that is supposed to lead the country back to civilian rule. Consolidating democracy will be no easy task. Since 1954, when a coup sponsored by the Central Intelligence Agency ended 10 years of civilian government, soldiers have dominated the country. Some of the military regimes, including that of Gen. Fernando Romeo Lucas Garcia, who ruled from 1978 to 1982, were among the most repressive in recent Latin American history. With Guatemala sharply criticized abroad because of the severity of its antiguerrilla campaign and with its economy in trouble, the army says it is prepared to return to the barracks and let politicians try to set things right.","abstract":null,"print_page":"2","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"GUATEMALA'S VOTERS TAKE A SMALL STEP"},"keywords":[{"name":"subject","value":"TERMS NOT AVAILABLE"}],"pub_date":"1984-07-08T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Week in Review Desk","section_name":"Week in Review","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Stephen","rank":1,"lastname":"KINZER"}],"original":"By STEPHEN KINZER"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd153138eb7c8105d635d70","word_count":801},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1984\/07\/13\/world\/uruguayan-cleric-to-head-council.html","snippet":"The Rev.

Emilio Castro, a Latin American Protestant figure who has played a major role in shaping liberation theology, was chosen today to head the World Council of Churches. Mr. Castro, a Methodist from Uruguay, was elected overwhelmingly by the council's central committee to succeed Dr. Philip A. Potter as general secretary of the world's largest ecumenical organization. The council is made up of 301 member churches from 14 traditions, including Protestants, Anglicans and Eastern Orthodox Christians. Officials here said the choice of the Latin American theologian and mission leader was seen as an attempt to install a general secretary who could set the council on a steadier, more integrated and more unified and tranquil course after years of controversy and disquiet.","abstract":null,"print_page":"3","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"URUGUAYAN CLERIC TO HEAD COUNCIL"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"POTTER, PHILIP"},{"name":"persons","value":"CASTRO, EMILIO"},{"name":"organizations","value":"WORLD COUNCIL OF CHURCHES"},{"name":"subject","value":"APPOINTMENTS AND EXECUTIVE CHANGES"}],"pub_date":"1984-07-13T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Foreign Desk","section_name":"World","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"firstname":"Kenneth","middlename":"A.","lastname":"BRIGGS","rank":1,"role":"reported","organization":""}],"original":"By KENNETH A.

Emilio Castro, elected Thursday as general secretary of the World Council of Churches, was reared as one of nine children of working-class parents in Uruguay, where deep secular inroads made Christian faith very weak by Latin American standards. For a long time, the Government showed its disdain for Christian belief by spelling God with with a small ''g,'' Mr. Castro recalled in interview recently. Moreover, Mr. Castro later left the Roman Catholic Church of his upbringing to become a member of the Evangelical Methodist Church, a small group of Christians whose presence in Uruguay was scarcely known. Mr. Castro brings to his new post the lessons he has learned from many years of a vocation as pastor, teacher and missionary.","abstract":null,"print_page":"4","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"COMPASSIONATE PASTOR","kicker":"MAN IN THE NEWS"},"keywords":[{"name":"subject","value":"TERMS NOT AVAILABLE"}],"pub_date":"1984-07-14T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Foreign Desk","section_name":"World","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"firstname":"Kenneth","middlename":"A.","lastname":"BRIGGS","rank":1,"role":"reported","organization":""}],"original":"By KENNETH A.

The change in policy has been under discussion in senior military circles for several years, but it was only formalized last month when the Health Ministry inaugurated a health program primarily intended to make birth-control methods available to poor women. With its population growing by 2.4 percent a year and expected to rise from 130 million today to 180 million in the year 2000, Brazil was until now the most populous developing country in the world without a government family-planning program. 'Acts Like a Steamroller' ''This country will never improve itself by growing in this way,'' Air Brig. Waldyr Vasconcelos, Chief of Staff of the armed forces, said recently.

But today the president of F.I.F.A., the international soccer federation, said that the organization was simply avoiding hypocrisy. Speaking sometimes in Spanish and sometimes in French, with translation headsets provided to the journalists on hand, Dr. Joao Havelange compared players from professional soccer teams with athletes in track and field, who have lucrative endorsement contracts, and with state-supported athletes in socialist nations. 'What is the difference between a contract with an industry and a contract with a club?' said Havelange, a 68-year-old Brazilian.
