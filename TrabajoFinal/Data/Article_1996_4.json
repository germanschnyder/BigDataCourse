Kennedy Stadium in a game that will be shown live by ESPN, and the Kansas City Wiz will visit Los Angeles in the opening games of the two-of-three-game series.

While many tour companies offer trips to the Amazon region and to the Inca ruins of Machu Picchu, most do not combine the sites on the same itinerary. Depending on which part of the Amazon you want to see, the minimum distance from there to Machu Picchu is several hundred miles, and given the limitations on transportation for many segments of the river, the logistics can be considerable for a full group.
