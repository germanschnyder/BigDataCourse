But other experts cautioned that the agreement would move the countries closer to formation of a cartel if their loan burden worsened. The 11 countries concluded a two-day meeting in Cartagena, Colombia, with a statement calling for more lenient terms for their loan payments and setting up regular meetings. The next is to be in Buenos Aires in September.","abstract":null,"print_page":"11","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"DEBT TALKS DRAW A MIXED REACTION"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"KINGON, ALFRED"},{"name":"glocations","value":"LATIN AMERICA"},{"name":"glocations","value":"COLOMBIA"},{"name":"subject","value":"DEFAULTING"},{"name":"subject","value":"UNITED STATES INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS"},{"name":"subject","value":"CREDIT"}],"pub_date":"1984-06-24T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Foreign Desk","section_name":"World; Washington","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"firstname":"Peter","middlename":"T.","lastname":"KILBORN","rank":1,"role":"reported","organization":""}],"original":"By PETER T.

Bolivian publishers are campaigning to overturn a licensing measure that took effect last month. Six newspapers in the Dominican Republic have gone to court to fight a licensing law enacted earlier this year. A reporter from the United States, prosecuted for working without a license as a journalist for papers in Costa Rica, is challenging that country's five-year-old licensing law before an international commission in Washington. Licensing and Control ''In licensing lies control, and a controlled press is not - for it cannot be - independent and free,'' the American Society of Newspaper Editors said in a recent bulletin about the case in Costa Rica.","abstract":null,"print_page":"1","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"LICENSING OF LATIN JOURNALISTS GIVES RISE TO GROWING FEARS"},"keywords":[{"name":"subject","value":"TERMS NOT AVAILABLE"}],"pub_date":"1984-06-24T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Foreign Desk","section_name":"World","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Jonathan","rank":1,"lastname":"FRIENDLY"}],"original":"By JONATHAN FRIENDLY"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd139fb8eb7c8105d60ec3b","word_count":1608},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1984\/06\/24\/world\/press-unit-plea-on-paraguay-ban.html","snippet":"The Inter-American Press Association asked President Alfredo Stroessner on Friday to lift the three- month-old suspension of the nation's largest daily newspaper, ABC Color, and was told the request would be considered.

The press association president, Horacio Aguirre, director of Las Americas of Miami, said the request was made both orally and in writing at a cordial 40-minute meeting with General Stroessner, who has ruled this nation since he took power in a military coup in May 1954. Also attending the meeting was Edward Seaton of Seaton Publications in Manhattan, Kan., vice president of the press association's executive committee, which is on a five-day visit to Paraguay and Uruguay to study restrictions on press freedom. The committee is accompanied by a former president of the group, George Beebe of The Miami Herald; Charles Scripps of the Scripps- Howard Newspapers Group, and Andres Garcia Lavin of Novedades de Yucatan of Merida, Yucatan, Mexico.","abstract":null,"print_page":"14","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"PRESS UNIT PLEA ON PARAGUAY BAN"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"ZUCCOLILLO, ALDO"},{"name":"persons","value":"STROESSNER, ALFREDO"},{"name":"glocations","value":"PARAGUAY"},{"name":"organizations","value":"ABC COLOR"},{"name":"organizations","value":"INTER-AMERICAN PRESS ASSOCIATION"},{"name":"subject","value":"GOVERNMENT NEWS POLICIES"},{"name":"subject","value":"POLITICS AND GOVERNMENT (1983)"},{"name":"subject","value":"NEWS AND NEWS MEDIA"}],"pub_date":"1984-06-24T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Foreign Desk","section_name":"World","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"organization":"AP","original":"AP","person":[]},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd150a48eb7c8105d6320fe","word_count":412},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1984\/06\/24\/weekinreview\/is-there-a-safe-way-out-for-the-uruguayan-military.html","snippet":"Although he was sitting in a Uruguayan military jail this weekend, Wilson Ferreira Aldunate, a leading presidential candidate, appeared to be just where he wanted to be - riding a surge of popularity.

But aggressive maneuvering by him and other civilian presidential aspirants, and by the country's military rulers, may upset prospects for Uruguay's first presidential election since 1971. The military, which seized power 11 years ago, has tired of taking the blame for economic disasters it has been unable to bring under control. Most of the generals have been looking for a safe way to unload their responsibilities without being placed on trial for human rights violations, as happened to former junta members in neighboring Argentina after that country returned to democracy last year.","abstract":null,"print_page":"5","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"IS THERE A SAFE WAY OUT FOR THE URUGUAYAN MILITARY?"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"POLITICS AND GOVERNMENT"},{"name":"persons","value":"FERREIRA ALDUNATE, WILSON"},{"name":"glocations","value":"URUGUAY"},{"name":"subject","value":"ARMAMENT, DEFENSE AND MILITARY FORCES"},{"name":"subject","value":"ELECTIONS"}],"pub_date":"1984-06-24T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Week in Review Desk","section_name":"Week in Review","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Edward","rank":1,"lastname":"SCHUMACHER"}],"original":"By EDWARD SCHUMACHER"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd139b08eb7c8105d60e417","word_count":859},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1984\/06\/25\/business\/imf-aide-s-hard-latin-role.html","snippet":"For Eduardo Wiesner Duran, an economist and politician who is now an international civil servant, these are not easy times.

Draft copies of the report, which State Department officials said would be made public next week without substantial revision, were sent to members of Congress today. The 35-page report, titled ''Background Paper: Nicaragua's Military Buildup and Support for Central American Subversion,'' was prepared jointly by the State Department and the Defense Department. It is the third report on Soviet, Cuban and Nicaraguan activities in Central America prepared by the Administration for public dissemination since 1981. It is intended, according to Administration officials, to assuage Congressional and public doubts about Administration contentions that Nicaragua has played a major role in trying to destabilize neighboring countries, particularly El Salvador.","abstract":null,"print_page":"3","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"AID TO SALVADOR REBELS IS SPORADIC, U.S. SAYS"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"REAGAN, RONALD WILSON"},{"name":"glocations","value":"SALVADOR, EL"},{"name":"glocations","value":"NICARAGUA"},{"name":"glocations","value":"LATIN AMERICA"},{"name":"glocations","value":"UNITED STATES"},{"name":"organizations","value":"DEFENSE, DEPARTMENT OF"},{"name":"organizations","value":"STATE, DEPARTMENT OF"},{"name":"subject","value":"UNITED STATES INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS"},{"name":"subject","value":"INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS"},{"name":"subject","value":"FINANCES"},{"name":"subject","value":"CIVIL WAR AND GUERRILLA WARFARE"},{"name":"subject","value":"FOREIGN AID"},{"name":"subject","value":"UNITED STATES ARMAMENT AND DEFENSE"}],"pub_date":"1984-06-30T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Foreign Desk","section_name":"World; Washington","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Philip","rank":1,"lastname":"TAUBMAN"}],"original":"By PHILIP TAUBMAN"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd139b08eb7c8105d60e4a4","word_count":756},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1984\/07\/04\/opinion\/washington-the-world-on-the-fourth.html","snippet":"A glance at the world on the 208th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence is not reassuring about the condition of liberty or democracy.

More nations have ''proclaimed liberty'' in the last 40 years, as the 13 American states did on July 4, 1776, than ever before, but comparatively few have followed it, and even the American people, now spread over a vast continent and beyond, are still arguing about what it means. Freedom House, the New York City organization that has been trying to monitor the state of human rights and civil liberties in the world for the last 11 years, notes some progress but little change in the last decade. In what it concedes is a difficult and controversial measuring process, it lists 52 countries as now ''free,'' the same as its calculation in 1973, 56 nations now ''partly free,'' as compared with 39 11 years ago, and 58 ''not free,'' as compared with 70 in its estimate of 1973.","abstract":null,"print_page":"15","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"WASHINGTON The World On the Fourth"},"keywords":[{"name":"subject","value":"POLITICS AND GOVERNMENT"}],"pub_date":"1984-07-04T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Editorial Desk","section_name":"Opinion","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"James","rank":1,"lastname":"Reston"}],"original":"By James Reston"},"type_of_material":"Op-Ed","_id":"4fd150a08eb7c8105d631dfe","word_count":861},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1984\/07\/07\/opinion\/no-headline-050818.html","snippet":"Brazil's Opening, Uruguay's Retreat It's not just size that distinguishes Brazil from its neighbor Uruguay.
