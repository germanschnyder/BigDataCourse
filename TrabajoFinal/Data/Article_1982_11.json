The first, at 12:30 P.M. in Fraunces Tavern Museum, 54 Pearl Street, at Broad (424-1776), goes to the very roots of going out in New York. Kym S. Rice will address herself to ''Visual Images of Tavern Life,'' showing in a slide lecture in these appropriate precincts what went on in New York's taverns during the 1700's as depicted in prints and paintings. They show not only the taverns of the time but also let you see the dining, drinking, smoking, gambling and dancing that even then were forging New York's national reputation. This series of tavern talks is leading up to the opening of a new exhibition, ''Taverns: For the Entertainment of Friends and Strangers,'' that opens in Fraunces's venerable quarters on Dec. 1, with Mrs. Rice as guest curator. Admission to her talk is free.","abstract":null,"print_page":"25","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"GOING OUT GUIDE"},"keywords":[{"name":"subject","value":"MUSIC"},{"name":"subject","value":"CONCERTS AND RECITALS"},{"name":"subject","value":"THEATER"}],"pub_date":"1982-11-18T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Cultural Desk","section_name":"Arts; Theater","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"firstname":"Richard","middlename":"F.","lastname":"Shepard","rank":1,"role":"reported","organization":""}],"original":"By Richard F.

Knopf. Some 30 Jewish military commanders huddled around a wireless set in their clandestine Jerusalem hideout, straining to hear through the static the votes of diplomats gathered half a world away at a gray old skating rink in Flushing Meadows, across the river from Manhattan. It was the week of Thanksgiving 1947, and at its tempo-rary home in the New York World's Fair grounds, the new United Nations General Assembly was deciding whether to offer Jews and Arabs sovereign states of their own in Palestine. Whatever the outcome, the soldiers in Jerusalem were prepared for trouble. ''If the vote is positive, the Arabs will make war on us,'' said Yitzhak Sadeh, a leader of the Jewish defense forces. ''And if the vote is negative, then it is we who will make war on the Arabs.''","abstract":null,"print_page":"88","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"THE PARTITION OF PALESTINE 35 YEARS AGO"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"MIDDLE EAST"},{"name":"glocations","value":"ISRAEL, STATE OF"},{"name":"organizations","value":"UNITED NATIONS"},{"name":"subject","value":"PALESTINIANS"},{"name":"subject","value":"JEWS"},{"name":"subject","value":"BOUNDARIES AND TERRITORIAL ISSUES"},{"name":"subject","value":"HISTORY"}],"pub_date":"1982-11-21T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Magazine Desk","section_name":"Magazine","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Peter","rank":1,"lastname":"Grose"}],"original":"By Peter Grose"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd128458eb7c8105d5ef16e","word_count":5385},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1982\/11\/25\/world\/us-said-to-give-up-on-a-un-inquiry.html","snippet":"A United States official said today that Washington planned to allow the United Nations inquiry into the use of chemical weapons in Asia to die because the investigators had made themselves powerless to reach judgments.

The official, Kenneth L. Adelman, the deputy United States delegate here, said he expected that the United Nations team would soon publish its second inconclusive report on American accusations that Communist forces were using illegal chemical and biological agents against insurgents in Afghanistan, Laos and Cambodia. In the United States' view, the inability of the experts to reach conclusions flows from their own, self-defeating standards of proof. In its first report, the United Nations team said last year that it could make no judgment unless it could collect evidence at the site soon after a reported attack.","abstract":null,"print_page":"17","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"U.S. SAID TO GIVE UP ON A U.N.

There is the initial shock, and concern about what the medical future may mean and about the bills that soon begin to come in. These bills can easily run into thousands of dollars, with little if any part of it covered by insurance unless precautions are taken in advance. This writer was relatively lucky. On a sunny midsummer Sunday morning, he suffered a heart attack at a flea market near Reading, Pa. The pain was mild and intermittent at first, so he shunned an offer to call an ambulance and, instead, had his wife drive him eight miles to the Reading Hospital, where he was sharply warned that any further move at that time might prove fatal. Only eight days later did the doctors there permit him to be moved by ambulance, accompanied by two emergency medical technicians and a registered nurse, to a hospital in Philadelphia, where he could be close to his home, family, longtime personal physician and friends. People in the ambulance business say the bill for the 60-mile move was amazingly cheap: only $125, but the patient had to pay it all himself, because none of his insurance covered it.","abstract":null,"print_page":"3","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"PRACTICAL TRAVELER: IF ILLNESS STRIKES ONE FAR FROM HOME"},"keywords":[{"name":"subject","value":"MEDICINE AND HEALTH"},{"name":"subject","value":"TRAVEL AND VACATIONS"}],"pub_date":"1982-11-28T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Travel Desk","section_name":"Travel","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Paul","rank":1,"lastname":"GRIMES"}],"original":"By PAUL GRIMES"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd13af88eb7c8105d610580","word_count":1268},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1982\/11\/29\/world\/uruguayans-elect-party-leaders-in-one-step-toward-democracy.html","snippet":"Uruguayans voted for the first time in nine years of military rule today to elect political leaders who will negotiate a return to democracy.
