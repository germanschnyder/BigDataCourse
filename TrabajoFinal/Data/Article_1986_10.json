At Northwestern University, outside of Chicago, a faculty member was denied tenure after she had disrupted a speaking engagement by anti-Sandinista guerrilla leaders from Nicaragua. Recalling the ferment generated by the war in Vietnam, the heated national debate over United States policy toward countries such as El Salvador and Nicaragua has sparked intense interest and reflection on the nation's campuses. But this interest is manifested in much more than demonstrations. It has also resulted in increases in enrollments in courses on Latin American history, economics, politics, religion and anthropology and in the introduction of major new programs and institutes of Latin American studies at several schools. In addition it has raised questions among specialists in the field as to how and what to teach about Latin America in an atmosphere that is so politically charged.","abstract":null,"print_page":"48","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"LATIN AMERICAN STUDIES EMERGE FROM THE ACADEMIC SHADOWS"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"LATIN AMERICA"},{"name":"subject","value":"ARCHEOLOGY AND ANTHROPOLOGY"},{"name":"subject","value":"UNITED STATES INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS"},{"name":"subject","value":"COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES"},{"name":"subject","value":"RELIGION AND CHURCHES"},{"name":"subject","value":"POLITICS AND GOVERNMENT"},{"name":"subject","value":"ENROLLMENT"},{"name":"subject","value":"HISTORY"},{"name":"subject","value":"ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND TRENDS"},{"name":"subject","value":"SPECIAL SECTIONS"}],"pub_date":"1986-08-03T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Survey of Education Desk","section_name":"Education; U.S.; Washington","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Larry","rank":1,"lastname":"Rohter"}],"original":"By Larry Rohter"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd1655d8eb7c8105d652585","word_count":3288},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1986\/08\/04\/business\/canada-s-dismay-over-wheat.html","snippet":"The United States Senate's vote two weeks ago to extend the sale of subsidized wheat exports to the Soviet Union and China, vigorously opposed by Secretary of State George P.

Shultz and the Australian Government, has also led to dismay on the table-flat Canadian prairie. The vote was followed by President Reagan's decision on Friday to authorize the sale of 3.85 million metric tons of subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union. ''If you're going to drop prices that way, we're going to follow,'' said Lorne Parker, who, with his son, farms 2,100 acres in Manitoba's Red River Valley. ''And we will do so until we go broke.'' The Senate action on July 22 -which has been supported by the House Agriculture Committee - has drawn stiff protests from Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, as well as Australian Prime Minister Robert Hawke, who object strenuously to subsidized sales to Moscow and Peking. Although both countries' share of the world wheat trade has risen this decade at the expense of the Americans, they decry the havoc the raging wheat war between the United States and Europe is wreaking on their own farmers.","abstract":null,"print_page":"1","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"CANADA'S DISMAY OVER WHEAT"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"AUSTRALIA"},{"name":"glocations","value":"CHINA, PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF"},{"name":"glocations","value":"CANADA"},{"name":"glocations","value":"UNION OF SOVIET SOCIALIST REPUBLICS"},{"name":"glocations","value":"UNITED STATES"},{"name":"organizations","value":"EUROPEAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY"},{"name":"subject","value":"INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND WORLD MARKET"},{"name":"subject","value":"PRICES"},{"name":"subject","value":"CROP CONTROLS AND SUBSIDIES"},{"name":"subject","value":"LAW AND LEGISLATION"},{"name":"subject","value":"GRAIN"}],"pub_date":"1986-08-04T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Financial Desk","section_name":"Business","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Douglas","rank":1,"lastname":"MARTIN"},{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":2}],"original":"By DOUGLAS MARTIN, Special to the New York Times"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd166358eb7c8105d65412c","word_count":1398},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1986\/08\/04\/business\/us-europe-trade-talks-fail.html","snippet":"The United States and the European Community failed today to resolve a lingering dispute over citrus and pasta products, and the community warned that a major trade war could break out if the impasse continued.

Negotiations over the weekend between the United States trade representative, Clayton K. Yeutter, and the community's External Relations Commissioner, Willy de Clercq, broke down after the two sides fell short of a compromise over a lowering of European Community tariffs on American citrus products and a reduction of community subsidies for pasta exports.

Yet, with the renown that he had earned by taking part in the kidnapping of a United States Ambassador here a decade earlier, Mr. Gabeira was expected to assume a role of leadership in the traditional left's new nonviolent bid for power. Instead, the slim, soft-spoken writer chose a different kind of campaign: in books, lectures and interviews, he began bombarding this society with ideas transplanted from Western Europe and assaulting the orthodoxy of Brazil's array of small Marxist parties. ''I wanted to show that we were defeated historically and could not just offer our suffering but had to offer something different,'' he said, adding a sharp aside about the established leftist parties: ''They're always the same. They never change.''

At least, the 400 of them who are here for the Festival Latino in New York are doing just that in what has become one of the world's most important arenas for Hispanic performing arts. The festival, which runs through Aug. 31 with representatives from more than a dozen countries, occupies the outdoor Delacorte Theater and the downtown Public Theater of the New York Shakespeare Festival -whose leader, Joseph Papp, has been the guiding light of this annual event. This is the 10th anniversary of the first Festival Latino, which was put together on a shoestring $25,000 budget. It was not until the next one, in 1980, that the festival settled in as a yearly feature of summer life in New York. This year, with a budget of more than $1 million and running for 26 days, the festival is presenting 34 companies - six musical, four dance and the rest theatrical - along with more than 20 films, most of them new to New York, and two weeks of video.","abstract":null,"print_page":"1","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"EXTRAVAGANZA OFFERS A FEAST OF LATIN EVENTS","kicker":"A FLURRY OF FESTIVALS, INDOORS AND OUT"},"keywords":[{"name":"creative_works","value":"FESTIVAL LATINO IN NEW YORK"},{"name":"subject","value":"FESTIVALS"},{"name":"subject","value":"SPANISH-SPEAKING GROUPS (US)"},{"name":"subject","value":"CULTURE"}],"pub_date":"1986-08-08T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Weekend Desk","section_name":"Arts","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"firstname":"Richard","middlename":"F.","lastname":"SHEPARD","rank":1,"role":"reported","organization":""}],"original":"By RICHARD F.
