''Today the dreams of 15 million Chileans are with us, and also the hopes of all Latin America,'' the president of Chile, Ricardo Lagos, said at a meeting of leaders of the European Union, Latin America and the Caribbean. The host, Prime Minister Jos\u00e9 Maria Aznar of Spain, hailed the agreement as a ''landmark in European foreign policy.'' The union is negotiating a similar deal with the Mercosur block of Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay.

Lassiter scored 88 goals during six seasons with Tampa Bay, D.C. United, Miami and Kansas City.

He was the son of Dr. William Resnik, a well-known cardiologist, and Lorraine Smith Resnik, a musicologist. He is survived by a sister, Kate Resnik Adler, a retired psychologist, of Easton, MD. Mr. Resnik graduated from Brooks School, Yale College and Harvard Law School. He also attended the London School of Economics. In his early career he worked for the Agency for International Development, U.S.State Department, serving in Washington, DC and Uruguay. Later he was a corporate lawyer for ITT in the U.S. and Europe. He also founded The Wine Bar in New York City which he modeled after similar places in Paris. On the basis of his own experience he wrote a book called ''The Small Business Bible,'' which was subsequently translated into several different languages. He then incorporated the principles described in ''The Small Business Bible'' into a joint project with Yale University to help inner-city kids think and express themselves. Mr. Resnik moved from New York to Santa Fe in 1998 and immersed himself in an array of local artistic and philanthropic activities. Among the institutions he supported were the School for American Research and the Southwest Literary Center. In recognition of his contributions, the Southwest Literary Center has announced that a Paul Resnik Narrative Center will be established in his name. He was deeply interested in books and ideas and loved music, art, theater, movies, politics and history. His many friends considered him a man for all seasons, a renaissance man, with a strong social conscience and a searching inquiring mind, an irreverent wit and a deep humanitarian spirit. He was in the process of researching a bold new work on the 1912 elections at the time of his death. Friends are planning a memorial service on July 3 in Santa Fe.

They want him in Germany. They want him in Italy. And after he plays for the United States national team in South Korea at the World Cup, which starts this week, they may want him in several other countries as well. But the place they need him most is the United States, where, oddly enough, he is least likely to end up. What makes Mathis such a prized commodity is his ability to create goals at any time and from anyplace on the field, the rarest and most precious skill in a sport where a final score of 2-1 reflects a fiesta of rollicking, high-octane offense. No American has ever scored at such a prolific rate as Mathis over the past season and a half or so -- 9 goals and 6 assists in 21 games for the national team, and 20 goals (and 18 assists) in 31 games for his club, the New York\/New Jersey MetroStars of Major League Soccer. The goals he scored and set up in 2000 and 2001 propelled the United States to four victories in the early part of the World Cup qualification process, and after he went down with torn knee ligaments last June and the Americans lost several matches before narrowly qualifying, it became clear that he had been the difference between getting to Asia and abject disaster. This year, he returned from the injury and performed brilliantly in several World Cup tuneup games, showcasing not only his magic with the ball but also his fiery temperament and, as important to soccer stardom as anything, his charismatic ability to entertain the crowd. To the national team, which won't get anywhere unless he leads the way again, and to the money-hemorrhaging pro league here that has staked its future on the Americans' performance, Mathis is It.","abstract":"Jeff Z Klein profile of top soccer player Clint Mathis, who plays for United States team at World Cup; sees European team likely to lure him away from New York\/New Jersey MetroStars of struggling Major League Soccer; photo (M)","print_page":"40","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"America's Best Shot"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"MATHIS, CLINT"},{"name":"subject","value":"WORLD CUP (SOCCER)"},{"name":"subject","value":"SOCCER"},{"name":"subject","value":"BIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION"}],"pub_date":"2002-05-26T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Magazine Desk","section_name":"Magazine","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"firstname":"Jeff","middlename":"Z.","lastname":"Klein","rank":1,"role":"reported","organization":""}],"original":"By Jeff Z.
