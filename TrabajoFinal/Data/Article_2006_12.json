While she was there, Ms. Fonseca, a daughter of Gonzalo Fonseca, the Uruguayan sculptor who died in 1997, became fascinated with the vanishing world of the gaucho, the South American cowboy, and life on an estancia, or ranch. She began collecting bits of that world, antique textiles and hides from the antiques market and the tanneries there, and making them into contemporary pieces -- pony skin couches, rabbit throws, parchment hide screens -- to import for sale in New York. This year, she's filling a storefront with her new collection, as well as photographs of gauchos and the South American countryside by Luis Fabini and prints made by her brother, the painter Caio Fonseca. Antique textiles are $1,200 to $2,300; a cedar-framed sofa covered in pony hide is $5,800; armless pony hide chairs are $2,000. Woven suede curtains are $2,300, rabbit fur throws are $900 and skunk fur pillows are $425.","abstract":"Quina Fonseca Design Collection showroom in Manhattan features items from vanishing world of gaucho, South American cowboy, and life on estancia, or ranch;
