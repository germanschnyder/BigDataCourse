Yet goals are rather rare, so it must be more complicated than that. Perhaps soccer's appeal lies in that contradiction: it is \"The Simplest Game,\" as the title of Paul Gardner's classic book puts it, but a simple game that is difficult to play well. Goals are treasured because they are so tantalizingly difficult to score. The craftiest and fleetest forward may be stripped of the ball by a slow but wise defender who has perfectly anticipated the forward's next move; the wisest defender may be fooled by an attacker who can glide one way, then dart the other. The game's beauty lies in the artistry and power of its players, more than in the tactics of coaches or the machinations of rules.","abstract":null,"print_page":"6","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Soccer On Its Own Terms","kicker":"WORLD CUP '94: ART OF SOCCER"},"keywords":[{"name":"subject","value":"WORLD CUP (SOCCER)"},{"name":"subject","value":"SOCCER"}],"pub_date":"1994-06-12T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Sports Desk","section_name":"Sports","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd1c58c8eb7c8105d6f5a4b","word_count":1183},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1994\/06\/12\/sports\/world-cup-94-the-history-winners-and-losers-from-uruguay-to-italy.html","snippet":"In 1904, FIFA, the world governing body for soccer, held its first meeting in Paris and reserved the right to hold a world championship.

Not that the Federation Internationale de Football Association wanted to rush into anything. It would be 26 more years before the World Cup was born. By 1930, soccer had grown uncomfortable with the Olympic insistence on amateurism. The sport needed a worldwide showcase for its best professional players. And since Uruguay was willing to pay for the three-week boat rides from Europe and build a 100,000-seat stadium, it was awarded the inaugural World Cup on the 100th anniversary of its independence.","abstract":null,"print_page":"3","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Winners and Losers, From Uruguay to Italy","kicker":"WORLD CUP '94: THE HISTORY"},"keywords":[{"name":"subject","value":"WORLD CUP (SOCCER)"},{"name":"subject","value":"SOCCER"}],"pub_date":"1994-06-12T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Sports Desk","section_name":"Sports","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Jere","rank":1,"lastname":"LONGMAN"}],"original":"By JERE LONGMAN"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd1e4598eb7c8105d72e821","word_count":1074},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1994\/06\/12\/sports\/world-cup-94-the-history-one-remarkable-upset-is-only-highlight-for-us-team.html","snippet":"So far, the history of the United States in the World Cup begins and ends with a game in the Brazilian mining town of Belo Horizonte on June 29, 1950.

But the outside world crashed in on this literary island last week when Viacom, which recently acquired Simon & Schuster as part of its Paramount package, swooped into the publishing house and sacked the man who'd built it into a powerhouse in recent decades, Richard E. Snyder. The publishing world's reaction: shock, mystification -- and jitters about the fate of various authors. Viacom gave a well-worn explanation: a difference in styles. But it soon spied a gathering storm, and moved quickly to calm it, going out of its way to state its \"commitment to literature and the printed word.\" Of course, not everyone at Simon & Schuster mourned, as some were glad to bid farewell to what they called Mr. Snyder's explosive temper. They expected his successor, Jonathan Newcomb, to set a softer tone.","abstract":null,"print_page":"2","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Business Diary: June 12-17"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"1994-06-19T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Financial Desk","section_name":"Business","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1}],"original":"By Hubert B.
