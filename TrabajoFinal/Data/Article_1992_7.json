That concept has affected art institutions in different ways. Manhattan's major museums, like the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Museum of Modern Art, have tried to diversify their programs and collections, but at their own pace. The Bronx Museum of the Arts -- situated in an area where minorities are now in the majority -- doesn't have this option. Multi-culturalism isn't theoretical; it's right outside the door. The museum was conceived in the 1960's by a group of Riverdale residents, in part to bring mainstream art to the Bronx. It was officially founded in 1971 with a show of Impressionist paintings on loan from the Met and displayed in the rotunda of the Bronx County Courthouse. Since then, it has moved to its own building and grown as a community-based, grass-roots institution, with all the liabilities that status implies. It doesn't have a reliable financial base in the form of a powerful board of trustees or wealthy patrons. (\"Simply put, we can't throw a party and clear $100,000,\" says the museum's president, Elizabeth Cooke.) And it doesn't have a long-established permanent collection like the Brooklyn Museum's to give it an academic pedigree.","abstract":null,"print_page":"14","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"The Art Market"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"STANISLAUS, GRACE"},{"name":"organizations","value":"BRONX MUSEUM OF THE ARTS"},{"name":"subject","value":"MINORITIES (ETHNIC, RACIAL, RELIGIOUS)"},{"name":"subject","value":"ART"}],"pub_date":"1992-08-28T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Weekend Desk","section_name":"Arts","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Holland","rank":1,"lastname":"Cotter"}],"original":"By Holland Cotter"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd1a1658eb7c8105d6b6ee9","word_count":1686},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1992\/09\/06\/business\/the-big-push-toward-privatization-in-argentina.html","snippet":"FOR decades, Argentine business had been a kind of secret society.

The economy was dominated by huge state industries. And amidst inflation and military coups, the big money was made by family-controlled oligopolies and monopolies that contracted with the Government. Intense lobbying, close ties with the military and political groups and, of course, payoffs at almost every level reaped lucrative contracts to build power plants, roads, bridges and dams. But the old ways are changing, as the Government of President Carlos Saul Menem sells off by the middle of next year a host of state-run businesses that were losing $5 billion a year. And four of Argentina's major industrial concerns -- Perez Companc, Techint, Comercial del Plata and Astra -- have not missed the opportunity to buy and are expected to end up with the concentration of power.","abstract":null,"print_page":"12","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"The Big Push Toward Privatization in Argentina"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"ARGENTINA"},{"name":"organizations","value":"TECHINT"},{"name":"organizations","value":"PEREZ COMPANC"},{"name":"organizations","value":"ASTRA AB"},{"name":"organizations","value":"COMERCIAL DEL PLATA"},{"name":"subject","value":"MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES"},{"name":"subject","value":"PRIVATIZATION"},{"name":"subject","value":"ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND TRENDS"}],"pub_date":"1992-09-06T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Financial Desk","section_name":"Business","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"firstname":"Nathaniel","middlename":"C.","lastname":"NASH","rank":1,"role":"reported","organization":""}],"original":"By NATHANIEL C.

Mr. Bond didn't even try to justify the sale in military or foreign policy terms. He said simply that it \"will allow the thousands of Missourians who build F-15's to stay on the job for years to come and to continue their critical contribution to our nation's security.\" That was at least honest; unlike foreign arms sales during the cold war, which usually had a strategic rationale, or could pretend they did, this one appears to have been driven exclusively by an effort to secure jobs and votes at home. It is part and parcel of the pork-barrel diplomacy instituted by the Bush Administration as it scrambles for a second term. And whatever this may do for its re-election chances, such sales also are going to have serious consequences for American foreign policy vis-a-vis China, Europe and the Middle East after Nov. 3.","abstract":null,"print_page":"4","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Selling Arms to Keep Jobs: The Signals It Sends Abroad","kicker":"THE WORLD"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"BUSH, GEORGE"},{"name":"glocations","value":"TAIWAN"},{"name":"glocations","value":"SAUDI ARABIA"},{"name":"subject","value":"ARMS SALES ABROAD"},{"name":"subject","value":"UNITED STATES INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS"},{"name":"subject","value":"MIDDLE EAST-INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS-US"},{"name":"subject","value":"ELECTION ISSUES"},{"name":"subject","value":"CHINA-INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS-US"},{"name":"subject","value":"UNITED STATES ARMAMENT AND DEFENSE"},{"name":"subject","value":"PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OF 1992"}],"pub_date":"1992-09-20T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Week in Review Desk","section_name":"Washington; Week in Review","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"firstname":"Thomas","middlename":"L.","lastname":"FRIEDMAN","rank":1,"role":"reported","organization":""}],"original":"By THOMAS L.
