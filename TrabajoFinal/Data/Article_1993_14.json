But however odd the coalition -- 132 Republicans and only 102 Democrats -- Mr. Clinton won a small economic and huge political victory in pushing Nafta through the House. Nafta will open Mexico's borders to more U.S. exports and investment, a worthwhile achievement. More important, the Nafta win empowers Mr. Clinton to complete the more important Uruguay Round of international trade talks. And the vote tells Congress that the White House knows how to play tough, which should make health care and welfare reform a bit easier to achieve.","abstract":null,"print_page":"32","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"After the Nafta Victory"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"CLINTON, BILL"},{"name":"subject","value":"NORTH AMERICAN FREE TRADE AGREEMENT"},{"name":"subject","value":"INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND WORLD MARKET"},{"name":"subject","value":"EDITORIALS"},{"name":"subject","value":"TREATIES"},{"name":"subject","value":"URUGUAY ROUND (TRADE TALKS)"}],"pub_date":"1993-11-19T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Editorial Desk","section_name":"Opinion","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"Editorial","_id":"4fd1bc2a8eb7c8105d6e77b5","word_count":466},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1993\/11\/19\/world\/france-now-faces-us-on-trade-issue.html","snippet":"The progress of the North American Free Trade Agreement has given an important spur to attempts to conclude a world trade agreement by Dec. 15, but it has also placed Prime Minister Edouard Balladur in a tight corner.   \"Last night, President Clinton...","lead_paragraph":"The progress of the North American Free Trade Agreement has given an important spur to attempts to conclude a world trade agreement by Dec. 15, but it has also placed Prime Minister Edouard Balladur in a tight corner. \"Last night, President Clinton won half the battle,\" Peter Sutherland, director general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, said today, summing up a widespread European feeling that if the accord had failed, global talks known as the Uruguay Round would have had scant chance of approval. \"I'm not here to tell you that the Uruguay Round is now in the bag,\" he said. \"It isn't.

But its passage was greeted with relief and excitement throughout Latin America and the Caribbean, where there is similar movement toward a closer relationship with the United States -- movement that would likely have been derailed had the trade pact been rejected. Just a decade ago, it would have been difficult to imagine Latin American leaders, with Mexico in the lead, clamoring for closer economic, political and cultural ties with the Colossus of the North, their historical nemesis. But a new breed of pragmatic reformer has emerged in country after country in recent years to put into practice the twin virtues of democracy and open markets that Washington had long been preaching. To them, Nafta was a test of both the sincerity and reliability of the United States.","abstract":null,"print_page":"5","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Latin America Finds Harmony in Convergence","kicker":"THE WORLD"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"LATIN AMERICA"},{"name":"glocations","value":"MEXICO"},{"name":"subject","value":"UNITED STATES INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS"},{"name":"subject","value":"INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS"},{"name":"subject","value":"NORTH AMERICAN FREE TRADE AGREEMENT"},{"name":"subject","value":"INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND WORLD MARKET"},{"name":"subject","value":"TREATIES"},{"name":"subject","value":"POLITICS AND GOVERNMENT"},{"name":"subject","value":"ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND TRENDS"}],"pub_date":"1993-11-21T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Week in Review Desk","section_name":"Washington; Week in Review","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Larry","rank":1,"lastname":"ROHTER"}],"original":"By LARRY ROHTER"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd1e9e68eb7c8105d738a63","word_count":1202},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1993\/11\/25\/business\/european-trade-official-hints-at-mollifying-french.html","snippet":"The European trade commissioner raised the possibility here today that some aspects of a negotiated agreement on world trade liberalization might be modified to satisfy French objections, particularly to allow a continuation of subsidies for French...","lead_paragraph":"The European trade commissioner raised the possibility here today that some aspects of a negotiated agreement on world trade liberalization might be modified to satisfy French objections, particularly to allow a continuation of subsidies for French farmers.
