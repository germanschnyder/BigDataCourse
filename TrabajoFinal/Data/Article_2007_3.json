But Mr. Drexler, above, is not so easy to pin down. The son of a German Jew who escaped the Holocaust, Mr. Drexler, 42, lived for a time in Israel, writing his first songs in Hebrew, then became a doctor in Uruguay and later settled in Spain. His music, too, is everywhere: a graceful, sophisticated kind of grown-up pop that borrows from bossa nova, Nick Drake and Radiohead but remains rooted in regional Uruguayan rhythmic styles like candombe and milonga. And in a soft, guileless tenor, accompanied by acoustic guitar strums or bubbling electronics, he sings of modern life as a Ping-Pong ball bouncing through countries and cultures, obliquely questioning old-fashioned ideas of national identity. The songs on his latest album, ''12 Segundos de Oscuridad'' (Warner Music Latina), are datelined like newspaper articles (''During the flight Madrid-LA,'' ''Amsterdam's Airport 2\/10\/06''), and nothing is fully grounded. In ''Transoce\u00e1nica'' he listens to a lover's ''versos melanc\u00f3licos'' while on a plane, and in ''Disneylandia'' he chronicles lightning-fast long-distance cultural exchanges (''Hindu music contrabanded by Polish Gypsies\/Is a hit in the interior of Bolivia'') in a frantic deadpan. Opening the show is Tania Libertad, a powerful and seductive Peruvian singer who lives in Mexico and has been known to twist Afro-Peruvian music into something like jazzy torch songs.
