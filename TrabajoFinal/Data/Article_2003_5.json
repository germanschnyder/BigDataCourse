In 1946 it presented the American premiere of Britten's ''Peter Grimes,'' a work commissioned by the conductor Serge Koussevitzky. That performance was conducted by a promising Koussevitzky prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Leonard Bernstein, and opera continued to be a major component of the center for 20 years. But the program then languished until the late 1980's, when the conductor Seiji Ozawa spearheaded its revival. On Sunday and Monday nights the center again attracted international attention through an ambitious offering: the world premieres of one-act operas by Robert Zuidam and Osvaldo Golijov, both alumni of the institute. The works were commissioned by the Boston Symphony.","abstract":"Anthony Tommasini reviews world premieres of Rage d'Amours, one-act opera by Robert Zuidam, and Ainadamar, one-act opera by Osvaldo Golijov, at Tanglewood Music Center; photos (M)","print_page":"1","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"New Operas Remember The Agony Of Lovers Left Behind","kicker":"TANGLEWOOD REVIEW"},"keywords":[{"name":"creative_works","value":"RAGE D'AMOURS (OPERA)"},{"name":"creative_works","value":"AINADAMAR (OPERA)"},{"name":"persons","value":"ZUIDAM, ROBERT"},{"name":"persons","value":"GOLIJOV, OSVALDO"},{"name":"organizations","value":"TANGLEWOOD MUSIC CENTER"},{"name":"subject","value":"REVIEWS"},{"name":"subject","value":"OPERA"}],"pub_date":"2003-08-13T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"The Arts\/Cultural Desk","section_name":"Arts","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Anthony","rank":1,"lastname":"TOMMASINI"}],"original":"By ANTHONY TOMMASINI"},"type_of_material":"Review","_id":"4fd246728eb7c8105d7e1569","word_count":1150},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2003\/08\/16\/books\/a-treasure-hunt-for-lost-memories.html","snippet":"Twenty years ago, an anthropologist named Teresa Porzecanski placed an advertisement in a Jewish newspaper serving this distant compass point of the Diaspora.

She was looking for the residue of an unrecorded history, the letters and snapshots of tens of thousands of immigrants from Eastern Europe and the Ottoman Empire. Mystified about why a scholar would care for the contents of their closets and bottom drawers, the aging immigrants or their offspring warily came forward, not only with mail and photographs but also with silverware, ritual candlesticks, samovars.

A trompe l'oeil peacock on the wall regards the woman in sweatpants with red hair and a not insignificant chest as she nervously paces this rather ordinary town house overgrown with gilded throne chairs and embassy-foyer trimmings. Though she lives in the upper registers of less-fashionable Fulham, the marquesa has Prince Ernst of Hanover as a neighbor -- and doesn't hesitate to say so. She knows things like that, the marquesa. She has to in her line of work: the snaring of celebrities and royals for the pages of Hello! magazine, pornography for a certain caste that wishes it could reliably pronounce the word ''Gstaad.'' The marquesa is what is known in the trade as a celebrity wrangler. At least one of this species is on staff at every major magazine obliged to enter the matrix of celebrity journalism. A wrangler generally answers to ''West Coast bureau chief,'' ''special projects director'' or ''entertainment editor,'' but everywhere the job is the same: to corral these preening unicorns by any means possible. Years before InStyle and Us magazine came along, Hello! was locking up cover-worthy faces and exclusive exclamation-point interviews. (The difference, of course, was that the marquesa often presented a check for the privilege.) The weekly raised a bubbly toast to Lladr\u00f3-level schmaltz and Ruritanian excess in flashy scrapbook spreads with happy-pill headlines. Between ''The Wedding,'' ''The Baby,'' ''The Heartbreak'' and, inevitably, ''The Divorce'' -- the points of Hello!'s compass -- there was always an opulent new residence to behold, a flurry of designer clothes blowing around every hard-won featurette stamped with the quirky signature, ''Co-ordination: Marquesa de Varela Int. Ltd.''","abstract":"Profile of Marquesa de Varela, who helps arrange high-profile celebrity interviews for British magazine Hello!; photos (L) (Part 2 of 2-part magazine Fashions of the Times)","print_page":"86","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"The Nutty Marquesa"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"VARELA, MARQUESA DE"},{"name":"organizations","value":"HELLO!"},{"name":"subject","value":"CELEBRITIES"}],"pub_date":"2003-08-17T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Fashions of The Times Magazine","section_name":"Style; Magazine","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Phoebe","rank":1,"lastname":"Eaton"}],"original":"By Phoebe Eaton"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd22f158eb7c8105d7bd18d","word_count":3291},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2003\/08\/18\/sports\/plus-cycling-final-pan-am-gold-goes-to-uruguayan.html","snippet":"Milton Wynants of Uruguay won the final gold medal of the Pan American Games, taking the men's 121-mile road cycling race in 4 hours 32 minutes 41 seconds.

The Uruguayan-flagged Viarsa is to be escorted to Cape Town, from where the crew of about 40 is to be flown to Australia to face charges of illegally fishing for the valuable toothfish, a spokeswoman for South Africa's Environmental Affairs Ministry said. The chase, with ships dodging icebergs in rough seas, put a spotlight on organized gangs that can earn $2 million for a shipload of the illegally plundered fish, which is also known as Chilean sea bass and is highly popular in the United States and Japan. Marine conservationists have warned that the deep-water fish, which can grow to seven feet long, could become commercially extinct by 2007.","abstract":"Australian and South African authorities capture Viarsa, Uruguayan-flagged fishing vessel illegally catching Patagonian toothfish, commonly known as Chilean Sea Bass, in Antarctic waters; 40 crewmen will face charges in Australia; shipload of endangered toothfish can bring $2 million at market (S)","print_page":"8","blog":[],"source":"Reuters","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"World Briefing | Off Antarctica: Dodging Icebergs, Ships Catch Fish Pirates"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"AUSTRALIA"},{"name":"glocations","value":"SOUTH AFRICA"},{"name":"glocations","value":"URUGUAY"},{"name":"glocations","value":"ANTARCTIC REGIONS"},{"name":"subject","value":"PRICES (FARES, FEES AND RATES)"},{"name":"subject","value":"ENDANGERED AND EXTINCT SPECIES"},{"name":"subject","value":"FISHING, COMMERCIAL"},{"name":"subject","value":"CHILEAN SEA BASS"},{"name":"subject","value":"FISH AND OTHER MARINE LIFE"}],"pub_date":"2003-08-28T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Foreign Desk","section_name":"World","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd22c588eb7c8105d7b854f","word_count":144},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2003\/08\/31\/arts\/the-new-ground-zero-there-s-nothing-so-closed-as-an-open-competition.html","snippet":"EVER since the effort to design the Vietnam Veterans Memorial made a star of a 21-year-old architecture student named Maya Lin, the open competition -- one that invites all comers to submit proposals -- has been the gold standard in selecting a...","lead_paragraph":"EVER since the effort to design the Vietnam Veterans Memorial made a star of a 21-year-old architecture student named Maya Lin, the open competition -- one that invites all comers to submit proposals -- has been the gold standard in selecting a design for a public memorial. So when officials overseeing the rebuilding of Lower Manhattan began to consider how to erect a homage to the victims of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, there was little question how they would structure the contest. Now, however, as the jury that will pick the winning design for the World Trade Center memorial trudges through 5,200 entries -- three times the number submitted for the Vietnam memorial in 1981 -- it might seem that the purpose of the exercise has been turned on its head. For while an open, anonymous competition is intended to make sure that every entry receives a fair viewing, the flood of proposals ensures that hundreds or even thousands of entries are likely to get no more than a moment's glance from jurors. The panel reviewing proposals for a memorial to victims of the Sept. 11 attack on the Pentagon, for example, vowed to consider every submission. Yet the members acknowledge that some proposals -- say, the full-scale, stainless steel model of an airplane mounted so that it would appear to be about to crash right into the Pentagon -- were viewed for only the briefest of moments.","abstract":"Article discusses difficult process faced by 13-person jury that must pick winning design for World Trade Center memorial from among 5,200 entries; photos (M)","print_page":"18","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"There's Nothing So Closed as an Open Competition","kicker":"THE NEW GROUND ZERO"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"NEW YORK CITY"},{"name":"subject","value":"WORLD TRADE CENTER (NYC)"},{"name":"subject","value":"AIRLINES AND AIRPLANES"},{"name":"subject","value":"AREA PLANNING AND RENEWAL"},{"name":"subject","value":"HIJACKING"},{"name":"subject","value":"ARCHITECTURE"},{"name":"subject","value":"MONUMENTS AND MEMORIALS"},{"name":"subject","value":"TERRORISM"}],"pub_date":"2003-08-31T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Arts and Leisure Desk","section_name":"Arts","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Edward","rank":1,"lastname":"WYATT"}],"original":"By EDWARD WYATT"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd22f198eb7c8105d7bd41c","word_count":1932},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2003\/09\/08\/arts\/musicians-gather-in-homage-to-allende.html","snippet":"More than just a pair of concerts, it was also a kind of exorcism.
