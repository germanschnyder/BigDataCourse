Three hours after the resignation, Vice President Itamar Franco was sworn in as President by the Brazilian Congress. Mr. Franco, a gentlemanly, little-known former Senator, is to serve out the rest of Mr. Collor's term, which ends in January 1995.

But the studio's owner, Nicolas Garcia Uriburu, Argentina's most noted environmental artist, has employed much larger canvases to convey his artistic message. Last fall, entering an inlet of water in the Buenos Aires port in an inflatable speedboat, he began dumping brick-red powder into the coffee-colored water, which immediately became laced with streaks of fluorescent green. The fountain in the middle of the inlet soon lifted the colored water, sending jets of green into the sky.","abstract":null,"print_page":"19","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Argentine's Art Delivers Ecological Messages"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"URIBURU, NICOLAS GARCIA"},{"name":"glocations","value":"ARGENTINA"},{"name":"subject","value":"ENVIRONMENT"},{"name":"subject","value":"BIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION"},{"name":"subject","value":"ART"}],"pub_date":"1992-12-31T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Cultural Desk","section_name":"Arts","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"firstname":"Nathaniel","middlename":"C.","lastname":"NASH","rank":1,"role":"reported","organization":""}],"original":"By NATHANIEL C.
