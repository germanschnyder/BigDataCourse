The vote was 150 in favor and 6 against -- including the United States -- with 10 abstentions. Last-minute amendments accepted by the Arab sponsors of the measure during a hastily called two-hour recess succeeded in gaining the support of all 25 members of the European Union and more than 30 other nations that had abstained the last time the matter came before the assembly. In that vote -- on Dec. 8, 2003, on a resolution that asked the international court to rule on the barrier's legality -- there were 74 abstentions, with 90 votes in favor and 8 against.","abstract":"UN General Assembly approves symbolic resolution demanding Israel obey World Court ruling to dismantle security fence on West Bank and pay compensation to Palestinians affected; vote is 150-6, US voting against 'unbalanced' measure; supporters include entire European Union; Israeli Amb Dan Gillerman points out that barrier was made necessary by Palestinian terrorism; photos (M)","print_page":"10","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Remove Wall, Israel Is Told By the U.N."},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"GILLERMAN, DAN"},{"name":"glocations","value":"WEST BANK"},{"name":"glocations","value":"ISRAEL"},{"name":"organizations","value":"EUROPEAN UNION"},{"name":"organizations","value":"UNITED NATIONS"},{"name":"organizations","value":"INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT"},{"name":"subject","value":"UNITED STATES INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS"},{"name":"subject","value":"PALESTINIANS"},{"name":"subject","value":"TERRORISM"}],"pub_date":"2004-07-21T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Foreign Desk","section_name":"World; Washington","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Warren","rank":1,"lastname":"HOGE"}],"original":"By WARREN HOGE"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd27e808eb7c8105d8475ca","word_count":911},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2004\/07\/22\/sports\/sports-briefing.html","snippet":"PRO BASKETBALL  Pistons Keep Wallace      Rasheed Wallace, an unrestricted free-agent forward who helped transform the Pistons from contenders to N.B.A. champions, has agreed to a five-year contract worth $57 million to return to Detroit, two people...","lead_paragraph":"PRO BASKETBALL Pistons Keep Wallace Rasheed Wallace, an unrestricted free-agent forward who helped transform the Pistons from contenders to N.B.A. champions, has agreed to a five-year contract worth $57 million to return to Detroit, two people told The Associated Press yesterday.","abstract":"Detroit Pistons re-sign forward Rasheed Wallace to five-year, $57 million contract (S)","print_page":"7","blog":[],"source":"AP","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Sports Briefing"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"WALLACE, RASHEED"},{"name":"organizations","value":"DETROIT PISTONS"},{"name":"subject","value":"BASKETBALL"}],"pub_date":"2004-07-22T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Sports Desk","section_name":null,"subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"News","_id":"52b88b2838f0d86bcb2a64d3","word_count":"679"},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2004\/08\/01\/travel\/practical-traveler-language-study-at-the-source.html","snippet":"MICHAEL LORENZ, a software systems analyst who lives in Pasadena, Calif., had a compelling reason to study Japanese.
