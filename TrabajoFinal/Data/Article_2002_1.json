The Argentine government says it cannot carry out the economic changes that the fund and other creditors are demanding unless it receives fresh money from abroad first, but foreign lenders say they cannot advance the country any new money until after it has shown some results. ''We need to break the circle,'' Economy Minister Jorge Remes Lenicov said last week before heading off to Washington to talk with I.M.F. officials. But neither side is willing to blink first. So the economy here, battered by a 50 percent devaluation of the peso, a freeze on bank deposits and a partial default on $141 billion in public debt, remains in a state of suspended animation.","abstract":"Argentine government says it cannot carry out economic changes that International Monetary Fund and other creditors are demanding unless it receives fresh money from abroad first, but foreign lenders say they cannot advance country any new money until after it has shown some results; US Treasury Sec Paul H O'Neill saye he sees Argentina's problems as largely self-inflicted, born of borrowing too freely to finance consumption rather than investment, speech to US Chamber of Commerce; photo of Pres Eduardo Duhald with Production Min Jose Ignacio de Mendiguren announcing new economic measures (M)","print_page":"1","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"In Argentina, I.M.F.

The Bush administration made the right call in imposing tariffs of up to 30 percent on selected steel imports from major exporting countries. The expression of support from industry, labor and Congress has been exceeded in volume by the howls of protest from our trading partners. Even so, this action was necessary for reasons beyond the immediate plight of the American steel industry. President Bush's action falls within the World Trade Organization agreement that lets nations take temporary measures to keep their domestic industries competitive. There is serious overcapacity in the steel industry worldwide. Negotiations about reducing production, conducted in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and elsewhere, have not alleviated the current glut of steel. Thirty-one American steel companies have gone bankrupt since 1997, and the steel industry in many nations is in jeopardy. As controversial as the tariff decision is, it is an effective way to jump-start serious talks and can pave the way for a major consolidation of the industry worldwide.","abstract":"Op-Ed article by Mickey Kantor, commerce secretary and trade representative in Clinton administration, says Pres Bush made right call in imposing tariffs on selected steel imports from major exporting countries, and for reasons beyond immediate plight of American steel industry; says not acting in face of obvious deterioration of American steel industry would create perception that US is unwilling to enforce trade laws; says failure to act would also be unhelpful to prospects of trade promotion authority now pending in Senate; says Bush's action falls within World Trade Orgn agreement, regardless of European Union complaint to WTO (M)","print_page":"21","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Tariffs May Temper a Glut of Steel"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"BUSH, GEORGE W"},{"name":"organizations","value":"WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION"},{"name":"organizations","value":"EUROPEAN UNION"},{"name":"subject","value":"INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND WORLD MARKET"},{"name":"subject","value":"STEEL AND IRON"},{"name":"subject","value":"CUSTOMS (TARIFF)"}],"pub_date":"2002-03-08T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Editorial Desk","section_name":"Opinion","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Mickey","rank":1,"lastname":"Kantor"}],"original":"By Mickey Kantor"},"type_of_material":"Op-Ed","_id":"4fd2628e8eb7c8105d814b96","word_count":616},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2002\/03\/11\/sports\/sports-of-the-times-subversive-doings-at-legion-field.html","snippet":"SOCCER in Alabama?
