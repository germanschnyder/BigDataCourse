Elkjaer registered the first three-goal game in the 24-team tournament as the Danes joined Brazil, which also won its first two games, as second-round qualifiers. In other games today, West Germany, which stands second in Group E with 3 points, beat Scotland, 2-1, and Belgium withstood a physical match with Iraq to win, 2-1, in Group B. There can be no questions now about the Danes' offense, as creative as any in the world. Against Uruguay, one of South America's best teams, Elkjaer and Laudrup, both of whom are stars on Italian clubs, were unstoppable.","abstract":null,"print_page":"17","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"DENMARK DEFEATS URUGUAY TO GAIN","kicker":"WORLD CUP"},"keywords":[{"name":"creative_works","value":"WORLD CUP (SOCCER)"},{"name":"glocations","value":"IRAQ"},{"name":"glocations","value":"DENMARK"},{"name":"glocations","value":"SCOTLAND"},{"name":"glocations","value":"BELGIUM"},{"name":"glocations","value":"WEST GERMANY"},{"name":"glocations","value":"URUGUAY"},{"name":"subject","value":"SOCCER"}],"pub_date":"1986-06-09T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Sports Desk","section_name":"Sports","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"organization":"AP","original":"AP","person":[]},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd170118eb7c8105d662bfc","word_count":470},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1986\/06\/11\/movies\/film-eyes-of-the-birds-depicts-uruguayan-jail.html","snippet":"THE Uruguayan prison for political prisoners is called - in the logic of authoritarianism - Libertad (Liberty).

Starting 10 players who make their living in leagues outside their homeland, and participating in its first World Cup, Denmark defeated West Germany, 2-0, to capture Group E. Called ''El Grupo de la Muerte'' -the Group of Death - because it was believed to be the strongest of the six groups in the first round, today it produced a vibrant match between two teams that had already qualified for the second round. By joining Brazil as the only teams to win all three first-round games, the Danes got to stay ''home'' in Queretaro, famous as the home of La Corregidora, the heroine in the struggle for independence of 1810, and also as the site of the execution of the Austrian puppet king, Maximilian, in 1867. Today's game decided the opponents for the second round. The Danes will play Spain, the second-place team in Group D, here next Wednesday while the West Germans will play Morocco, the surprising winner of Group F. There was some question whether Spain, with its strong tradition of soccer, was a less desirable opponent than Morocco, the first African team ever to reach the second round of the World Cup. But the latter game will be in Monterrey, hotter and at much lower altitude than the West Germans have been experiencing.","abstract":null,"print_page":"47","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"DENMARK BEATS W.
