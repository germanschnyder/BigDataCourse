Skakel in the 1975 murder of Martha Moxley said today that his statements on the matter had been ''blown out of proportion'' and that he did not know who had committed the murder. The latest statement by the possible witness, Gitano Bryant, made in a rambling phone interview that was monitored by his lawyer and coming on the heels of new information about his own criminal history and legal troubles, is likely to further cloud the uphill efforts by Mr. Skakel's lawyers to free him. Their latest efforts suggest that they plan to contend that two young men from the Bronx may have committed the murder on the night of Oct. 30, 1975.","abstract":"Lawyers trying to reverse conviction of Michael Skakel in 1975 murder of Martha Moxley say potential witness Gitano Bryant does not know who committed murder, further clouding their efforts on Skakel's behalf; had planned to seek new trial based mostly on Bryant's testimony (M)","print_page":"1","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Potential Witness in Moxley Case Denies Knowing Who Killed Girl"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"BRYANT, GITANO"},{"name":"persons","value":"MOXLEY, MARTHA"},{"name":"persons","value":"SKAKEL, MICHAEL"},{"name":"glocations","value":"GREENWICH (CONN)"},{"name":"subject","value":"MURDERS AND ATTEMPTED MURDERS"},{"name":"subject","value":"CHILDREN AND YOUTH"}],"pub_date":"2003-09-10T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Metropolitan Desk","section_name":"New York and Region","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"firstname":"Alison","middlename":"Leigh","lastname":"COWAN","rank":1,"role":"reported","organization":""}],"original":"By ALISON LEIGH COWAN"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd2314f8eb7c8105d7c0774","word_count":846},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2003\/09\/17\/business\/brazil-pushes-for-south-american-trade-pact.html","snippet":"Brazil, Latin America's largest economy, is pushing hard to form a continentwide trade pact by the end of the year that would give South American nations greater leverage as the United States pursues its own trade agreement for the hemisphere.    ...","lead_paragraph":"Brazil, Latin America's largest economy, is pushing hard to form a continentwide trade pact by the end of the year that would give South American nations greater leverage as the United States pursues its own trade agreement for the hemisphere.

Fourteen years into marriage, she retained a newlywed's capacity for exasperation on one particular husbandly quirk. ''Why,'' she asked, already knowing the answer, ''do you have to run today?'' If I were so insistent on doing my daily miles, she went on, then couldn't I at least do them in the fitness center? There was no place to jog on top of Nob Hill. Half the reason we'd chosen this hotel -- the Ritz-Carlton -- was a guidebook's rhapsody to its health club, which indeed included a full row of treadmills, each equipped with a personal television and headphone.","abstract":"Samuel G Freedman travel essay on joy of running in unfamiliar cities while on vacation; drawing (M)","print_page":"21","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"His Best Trips Are Never No Sweat"},"keywords":[{"name":"subject","value":"RUNNING"},{"name":"subject","value":"TRAVEL AND VACATIONS"}],"pub_date":"2003-10-26T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Travel Desk","section_name":"Travel","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"firstname":"Samuel","middlename":"G.","lastname":"FREEDMAN","rank":1,"role":"reported","organization":""}],"original":"By SAMUEL G.
