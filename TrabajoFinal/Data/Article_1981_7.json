Unheralded Bernard Fritz of France upset 10th-seeded Jose-Luis Damiani of Uruguay, 6-4, 6-1, and Hans Gildemeister of Chile overcame a brief attack of heat exhaustion to beat Angel Gimenez of Spain, 6-4, 1-6, 6-3. The other quarterfinal match, between Eliot Teltscher and Ricardo Cano of Argentina, was rained out tonight and rescheduled for tomorrow morning. Clerc will face the winner of that match tomorrow night, and Fritz will play Gildemeister in the other semifinal.","abstract":null,"print_page":"10","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"CLERC, UNSEEDED FRENCHMAN IN SEMIFINAL"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"MASSACHUSETTS"},{"name":"subject","value":"PROFESSIONAL ATHLETICS"},{"name":"subject","value":"TENNIS"}],"pub_date":"1981-07-19T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Sports Desk","section_name":"Sports","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1}],"original":"UPI"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd11d038eb7c8105d5dac13","word_count":333},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1981\/07\/23\/sports\/solomon-and-pecci-upset-in-2d-round.html","snippet":"Pascal Portes, a 22-year-old Frenchman, upset Harold Solomon, 1-6, 6-3, 6-2, and reached the third round of the $200,000 Washington Star tennis tournament today.

He deserves an answer, but first a resume of the pertinent law: On the basis of a resolution adopted at a meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the Organization of American States at Punte Del Este, Uruguay, President Kennedy issued Presidential Proclamation 3447 on Feb. 3, 1962. Pursuant to that proclamation, Treasury Secretary Dillon issued first the Cuban Import Regulations, effective Feb. 7, 1962, and then, on July 8, 1963, the Cuban Assets Control Regulations, which have been in effect ever since. Their purpose was to ban all trade with Cuba by citizens and residents of the United States, thus depriving Cuba of U.S. funds and products.","abstract":null,"print_page":"14","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"WHY THE U.S. KEEPS TRACK OF CUBAN JOURNALS"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"CUBA"},{"name":"subject","value":"WRITING AND WRITERS"},{"name":"subject","value":"LICENSES"},{"name":"subject","value":"UNITED STATE INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS"},{"name":"subject","value":"LAW AND LEGISLATION"}],"pub_date":"1981-07-27T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Editorial Desk","section_name":"Opinion","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"Letter","_id":"4fd11baf8eb7c8105d5d75fb","word_count":373},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1981\/07\/30\/sports\/clerc-and-vilas-win-opening-volvo-matches.html","snippet":"Jose Luis Clerc and Guillermo Vilas of Argentina scored opening-round victories today at the Volvo international tennis tournament.

It will emphasize the scope of United States maritime commitments and the fleet's reliance in a war on its allies, both inside and outside the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Some allies, notably the Norwegians, have shown reluctance to take part in the exercise. Their reason is that the first phase of the operation, which takes place in the South Atlantic, appears to extend NATO's role beyond the area stipulated in the North Atlantic Treaty.","abstract":null,"print_page":"4","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Military Analysis","kicker":"U.S. AND ALLIED NAVIES STARTING MAJOR TEST TODAY"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"UNION OF SOVIET SOCIALIST REPUBLICS"},{"name":"glocations","value":"UNITED STATES"},{"name":"glocations","value":"NORWAY"},{"name":"organizations","value":"NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY ORGANIZATION"},{"name":"subject","value":"ATOMIC WEAPONS"},{"name":"subject","value":"INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS"},{"name":"subject","value":"ARMAMENT, DEFENSE AND MILITARY FORCES"},{"name":"subject","value":"ARMS CONTROL AND LIMITATION AND DISARMAMENT"},{"name":"subject","value":"MILITARY EQUIPMENT"},{"name":"subject","value":"POLITICS AND GOVERNMENT"},{"name":"subject","value":"UNITED STATE INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS"},{"name":"subject","value":"ELECTIONS"},{"name":"subject","value":"UNITED STATES ARMAMENT AND DEFENSE"}],"pub_date":"1981-08-01T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Foreign Desk","section_name":"World","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Drew","rank":1,"lastname":"MIDDLETON"}],"original":"By DREW MIDDLETON"},"type_of_material":"An Analysis","_id":"4fd110f28eb7c8105d5c7020","word_count":861},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1981\/08\/02\/world\/around-the-world-uruguay-names-general-as-next-president.html","snippet":"Gen.

Kirkpatrick, whose ideas on authoritarian Governments in Latin America were provocative when she was a professor at Georgetown University, is leaving few doubts on her current tour that her views have not changed. In a press conference yesterday she said that psychoanalysis of Cuba's Fidel Castro would be needed to understand his motives and she accused the Soviet Union of expansionism and of propagating ''oneparty dictatorships.'' In an interview later she defended the Reagan Administration's moves to improve relations with the military Governments in Argentina, Chile, Uruguay and Brazil, saying that they had ''more elements of constitutionalism'' than many countries do. At the same time, she said she had raised concerns with Argentine officials about the nearly 900 political prisoners held in jail here without charges, although she sidestepped a question in the press conference about whether she also sought an accounting of the more than 6,000 people who have reportedly disappeared in the hands of state security forces.","abstract":null,"print_page":"3","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"LATINS GET TASTE OF KIRKPATRICK STYLE"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"LATIN AMERICA"},{"name":"subject","value":"UNITED STATE INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS"},{"name":"subject","value":"TRAVEL, PERSONAL"}],"pub_date":"1981-08-05T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Foreign Desk","section_name":"World","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Edward","rank":1,"lastname":"SCHUMACHER"},{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":2}],"original":"By EDWARD SCHUMACHER, Special to the New York Times"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd129668eb7c8105d5f110b","word_count":648},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1981\/08\/07\/sports\/miss-jaeger-gains-clerc-beats-gomez.html","snippet":"Top-seeded Andrea Jaeger defeated Sue Barker, 6-1, 6-7, 6-2, today and advanced to a semifinal meeting with third-seeded Mima Jausovec in the United States Open Clay Court tennis championships.
