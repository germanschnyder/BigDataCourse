The talks are aimed at lowering barriers on the nearly $4 trillion of annual world trade. The latest crisis resulted from a continuing failure to resolve farm trade issues. The new trouble revived earlier fears of a conference collapse that could bring trade wars and a general worldwide economic decline. \"It's back to ground zero,\" said John C. Crosbie, Canada's Trade Minister. 'Brutally Torpedoed' Australia's Minister for Trade Negotiations, Neal Blewett, said he had \"never before been in a meeting in which there was a promise of getting a breakthrough and it was so brutally torpedoed.\"","abstract":null,"print_page":"1","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"After Brief Hope, New Trade Snag"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"HILLS, CARLA A"},{"name":"glocations","value":"FRANCE"},{"name":"glocations","value":"UNITED STATES"},{"name":"organizations","value":"EUROPEAN COMMUNITY"},{"name":"subject","value":"AGRICULTURE"},{"name":"subject","value":"FARMERS"},{"name":"subject","value":"INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND WORLD MARKET"},{"name":"subject","value":"CROP CONTROLS AND SUBSIDIES"},{"name":"subject","value":"URUGUAY ROUND (TRADE TALKS)"}],"pub_date":"1990-12-07T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Financial Desk","section_name":"Business","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"firstname":"Clyde","middlename":"H.","lastname":"FARNSWORTH","rank":1,"role":"reported","organization":""},{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":2}],"original":"By CLYDE H.

Yesterday the talks were suspended when third world food exporting nations decided to pull out. President Mitterrand is known for grand rhetorical speeches on behalf of the world's poor nations. After this week in Brussels, the rhetoric rings hollow. The trade barriers Mr. Mitterrand is obstinately defending cost the third world two and a half times more than all the aid the industrialized nations dole out to them. Apparently, helping the poor of the world was not as high on his agenda as pan dering to a handful of wealthier domestic farmers.","abstract":null,"print_page":"24","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"The Europeans Sabotage Trade"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"KOHL, HELMUT"},{"name":"persons","value":"MITTERRAND, FRANCOIS"},{"name":"glocations","value":"GERMANY"},{"name":"glocations","value":"FRANCE"},{"name":"organizations","value":"EUROPEAN COMMUNITY"},{"name":"subject","value":"AGRICULTURE"},{"name":"subject","value":"FARMERS"},{"name":"subject","value":"INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND WORLD MARKET"},{"name":"subject","value":"EDITORIALS"},{"name":"subject","value":"CROP CONTROLS AND SUBSIDIES"},{"name":"subject","value":"PROTECTIONISM (TRADE)"}],"pub_date":"1990-12-08T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Editorial Desk","section_name":"Opinion","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"Editorial","_id":"4fd19d298eb7c8105d6af16d","word_count":562},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1990\/12\/08\/business\/trade-talks-end-without-mending-rift-over-farming.html","snippet":"A four-year round of talks to establish new rules for world trade broke off in disarray today as the United States and the European Community remained deadlocked over the issue of reducing subsidies to farmers.
