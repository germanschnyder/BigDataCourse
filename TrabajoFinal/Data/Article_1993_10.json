For Argentina, the closing of G.M.'s two plants was more than just the departure of a giant foreign corporation. It symbolized industrial descent, a country abandoned by most international businesses. But things change, and G.M. has now come back to Argentina.","abstract":null,"print_page":"1","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"G.M.'s Return Signals Revival for Argentina"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"MENEM, CARLOS SAUL"},{"name":"glocations","value":"PARAGUAY"},{"name":"glocations","value":"LATIN AMERICA"},{"name":"glocations","value":"BRAZIL"},{"name":"glocations","value":"ARGENTINA"},{"name":"glocations","value":"URUGUAY"},{"name":"glocations","value":"BUENOS AIRES (ARGENTINA)"},{"name":"organizations","value":"CIDEA"},{"name":"organizations","value":"GENERAL MOTORS CORP"},{"name":"organizations","value":"RENAULT SA"},{"name":"subject","value":"FOREIGN INVESTMENTS"},{"name":"subject","value":"JOINT VENTURES AND CONSORTIUMS"},{"name":"subject","value":"TRUCKS AND TRUCKING"},{"name":"subject","value":"PRICES"},{"name":"subject","value":"PRIVATIZATION"},{"name":"subject","value":"CURRENCY"},{"name":"subject","value":"ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND TRENDS"}],"pub_date":"1993-09-13T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Financial Desk","section_name":"Business","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"firstname":"Nathaniel","middlename":"C.","lastname":"NASH","rank":1,"role":"reported","organization":""}],"original":"By NATHANIEL C.

David Fonseca scored the winning goal during injury time at the end of the first half at Centenario Stadium in Montevideo, Uruguay. With only one round remaining in South American Group B, neither of the two berths is settled. Bolivia, Brazil and Uruguay all have 10 points with Sunday's two games to decide the issue. Bolivia, once seemingly secure in its bid for a World Cup bid, and Brazil need a draw to qualify. Uruguay needs a victory, or a draw and a Bolivian loss, to get to next summer's World Cup in the United States. (AP) AUTO RACING Hill Wins in Italy as Prost's Engine Blows Damon Hill had a bad start and a good finish in the Italian Grand Prix yesterday in Monza, Italy. His French teammate, Alain Prost, had quite the reverse. Jean Alesi of France thrilled Italian fans by driving a Ferrari to second place, and Michael Andretti finished third, his best Formula One finish this year, in a McLaren-Ford. Andretti, who fought back in the second half of the race after spinning off in the second lap, said he was delighted to have made his first trip to the podium in Formula One. Prost, a 38-year-old French veteran, saw his Renault engine explode four and a half laps from the checkered flag and from his fourth world title. He led for 48 laps after roaring off from the pole position. (AP) Fittipaldi Is Still in the Race: Emerson Fittipaldi kept the Indy-car championship battle alive with a runaway victory in the Pioneer Electronics 200 at Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course in Lexington, Ohio. It was a turnaround for Fittipaldi, who had been struggling since winning at Portland, Ore., on June 27, and a day of missed opportunities for PPG Cup point leader, Nigel Mansell, and Fittipaldi's teammate, Paul Tracy. Mansell, who went into the 199.3-mile, 89-lap race with a 34-point lead over Fittipaldi and a 47-point lead over Tracy, started from the pole and had a good chance to wrap up the championship with two races remaining. (AP) GOLF Birdie on 18th Gives Frost Canadian Title David Frost, given an opening by the back-nine collapse of Brad Bryant, two-putted for birdie on the final hole yesterday to win the Canadian Open by a stroke. The 34-year-old South African scored his seventh PGA Tour victory, closing with a four-under-par 68 for a 279 total on the Glen Abbey Golf Club course in Oakville, Ontario. (AP) Elements Are Kind to Murphy: First the weather took away some of Bob Murphy's weapons. Then it gave him his second victory on the Senior PGA Tour. Murphy became the winner of the GTE North Classic in Indianapolis when rain and lightning forced officials to cancel yesterday's final round of the 54-hole tournament. Murphy never had to take a club out of his bag to win with a 10-under 134. (AP) DOG SHOW Schnauzer Takes Top Honors A standard schnauzer, Ch. Kennebunk Special Beau, owned by Ruth Black, Dr. Katherine Black-Lee and Peter and Ramona Fine of Andover, Mass., was named best in show yesterday at the 76th Westchester Kennel Club fixture, the most prestigious outdoor show in the East, on the grounds of the Lyndhurst estate in Tarrytown, N.Y. It was the fourth top award for Beau, as the 5-year-old dog is called.","abstract":null,"print_page":"10","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"RESULTS PLUS"},"keywords":[{"name":"subject","value":"ATHLETICS AND SPORTS"}],"pub_date":"1993-09-13T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Sports Desk","section_name":"Sports","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd1bd098eb7c8105d6e9847","word_count":581},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1993\/09\/14\/business\/us-seeks-to-keep-world-trade-talks-on-track.html","snippet":"With France waging a strenuous campaign to overturn last winter's trans-Atlantic deal on farm subsidies, top American and European officials met here today in an effort to prevent the dispute from tearing apart seven-year-old world trade talks.
