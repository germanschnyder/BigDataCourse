With General Galtieri still in office and worried about his personal honor, it had seemed that the British military triumph might be followed by months of pointless wrangling and indecision. No one in Whitehall thinks the coming months will be easy, a Cabinet minister said on Friday, ''but at least we can get on with it, and at least we don't have to worry about the prisoners any more.'' After General Galtieri resigned, Argentina decided to facilitate return of most of the more than 10,000 captives taken after Stanley fell.","abstract":null,"print_page":"3","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"FOR BRITAIN AND THE FALKLANDS, THE POSTWAR WORLD IS SHAKY"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"FALKLAND ISLANDS"},{"name":"glocations","value":"GREAT BRITAIN"},{"name":"glocations","value":"ARGENTINA"},{"name":"subject","value":"ARMAMENT, DEFENSE AND MILITARY FORCES"},{"name":"subject","value":"INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS"},{"name":"subject","value":"BOUNDARIES AND TERRITORIAL ISSUES"}],"pub_date":"1982-06-20T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Week in Review Desk","section_name":"Week in Review","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"qualifier":"Jr","firstname":"R.","middlename":"W.","lastname":"APPLE","rank":1,"role":"reported","organization":""}],"original":"By R.W.

When she asks if they want fruits, vegetables and meat that stay fresher longer, they say yes. But when she mentions a preservation technique that promises to make those things possible, they respond, she says, by asking such half-serious questions as ''Does it make you glow in the dark?'' The technique is irradiation - exposing foods to gamma rays or electrons emitted by radioactive materials - and it may soon do to some consumer foods in this country what it has long done to cosmetics, hospital equipment, baby powders and meals astronauts have eaten on the moon and in orbit: kill off substantial amounts of bacteria in food or sterilize it altogether. The food itself does not become radioactive, just as dental and chest X-rays do not make teeth and lungs radioactive. In low doses, irradiation has little effect on taste.","abstract":null,"print_page":"1","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"IRRADIATED FOOD: PROMISE AND CONTROVERSY"},"keywords":[{"name":"subject","value":"FOOD AND GROCERY TRADE"},{"name":"subject","value":"RADIATION"},{"name":"subject","value":"FOOD ADDITIVES"}],"pub_date":"1982-06-30T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Living Desk","section_name":"Home and Garden","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"firstname":"James","middlename":"P.","lastname":"STERBA","rank":1,"role":"reported","organization":""}],"original":"By JAMES P.

The muddy streets and fields of Stanley will be cleared within three months of seven million rounds of live ammunition, but it may not be for years, if ever, that as many as 12,000 mines can be removed. They include small plastic devices scattered from helicopters in the final days of the war with Argentina. Children, who have come to call them ''green pebbles,'' are kept at home by fearful parents. Jeanne Sheridan, a mother of two, said, ''We'll never be able to cross those fields to gather teaberries again.'' Because of the mines, there is no driving outside of Stanley, no fishing and no collection of peat, which is used for heating.","abstract":null,"print_page":"1","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"UNEASE INVADES FALKLANDS IN WAR AFTERMATH"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"FALKLAND ISLANDS"},{"name":"glocations","value":"GREAT BRITAIN"},{"name":"glocations","value":"ARGENTINA"},{"name":"subject","value":"INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS"}],"pub_date":"1982-07-26T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Foreign Desk","section_name":"World; Front Page","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"James","rank":1,"lastname":"FERON"},{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":2}],"original":"By JAMES FERON, Special to the New York Times"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd123ee8eb7c8105d5e8190","word_count":1840},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1982\/07\/27\/sports\/wilkison-is-upset-in-jersey-by-6-1-7-5.html","snippet":"Sixth-seeded Tim Wilkison was upset by Erick Iskersky, 6-1, 7-5, today as play began in the $150.000 Mutual Benefit Life Open tennis tournament.
