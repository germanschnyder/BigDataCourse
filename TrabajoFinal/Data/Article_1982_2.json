The reduction had been supported by the league's more established teams, especially influential franchises such as the Cosmos, Chicago and Seattle. They thought that expansion from 18 to 24 teams in 1978 was a mistake. In fact, spokesmen for the Cosmos, Chicago and Seattle had said at a league meeting in Chicago two years ago that they would have liked to see the league reduced to 12 franchises, mostly by way of mergers. Dallas has been the only franchise that merged, however, joining forces with Tampa Bay. Six others have folded since last season and they were preceded by the demise of three others before last season. Atlanta, Calgary, California, Los Angeles, Minnesota and Washington are the franchises that have folded since last season. Of the six, Minnesota's loss was the only shocking development.","abstract":null,"print_page":"10","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"WITH FEWER TEAMS, THE GOAL IS BALANCE"},"keywords":[{"name":"subject","value":"SOCCER"},{"name":"subject","value":"PROFESSIONAL ATHLETICS"}],"pub_date":"1982-03-28T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Sports Desk","section_name":"Sports","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Alex","rank":1,"lastname":"YANNIS"}],"original":"By ALEX YANNIS"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd11e9c8eb7c8105d5ddd24","word_count":1561},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1982\/03\/28\/style\/lisa-york-gill-engaged-to-walter-gray.html","snippet":"Announcement has been made by Seta York McCormick of Shreveport, La., and Raymond Browning Gill Jr. of Huntsville, Ala., of the engagement of their daughter, Lisa York Gill, to Walter Evans Gray, son of Frank Biddle Gray of Montevideo, Uruguay, and...","lead_paragraph":"Announcement has been made by Seta York McCormick of Shreveport, La., and Raymond Browning Gill Jr. of Huntsville, Ala., of the engagement of their daughter, Lisa York Gill, to Walter Evans Gray, son of Frank Biddle Gray of Montevideo, Uruguay, and Blanche Fleming Gray of Memphis.
