The Italians will also play Argentina and South Korea in the first round of the World Cup, the quadrennial tournament that will be in 12 stadiums in several major Mexican cities from May 31 through June 29.

According to officials involved in preparing the conference, the consensus in the region is that the Reagan Administration's new initiative to ease the three-year-old debt crisis is ''positive but insufficient.'' They said foreign ministers and finance ministers from the 11-nation Cartagena Group would therefore ''build on'' proposals made by Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d at the October meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in Seoul, South Korea. The Baker Plan calls for structural economic adjustments by 15 heavily indebted nations, including 10 in Latin America, in exchange for $9 billion in extra loans from the World Bank and $20 billion in ''new money'' from commercial banks over three years.","abstract":null,"print_page":"12","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"BAKER'S DEBT PLAN GETS LATIN SCRUTINY"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"BAKER, JAMES A 3D"},{"name":"glocations","value":"LATIN AMERICA"},{"name":"glocations","value":"THIRD WORLD AND DEVELOPING COUNTRIES"},{"name":"organizations","value":"INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT"},{"name":"subject","value":"CREDIT"},{"name":"subject","value":"ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND TRENDS"}],"pub_date":"1985-12-16T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Financial Desk","section_name":"Business","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Alan","rank":1,"lastname":"RIDING"},{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":2}],"original":"By ALAN RIDING, Special to the New York Times"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd167d38eb7c8105d6564bc","word_count":629},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1985\/12\/17\/style\/purloined-sweater-a-case-of-who-copied-whom-first.html","snippet":"Early in 1984, Crolla, an English fashion design team, showed a collection of flamboyant tapestrylike floral print clothes.

Sherlock Holmes might call what happened next the Case of the Cabbage Roses. The evolution of this single design as it ascended from the streets of London to a Paris runway, then descended to American mall-quality acrylic, illustrates a prevalent but rarely acknowledged fashion phenomenon known in the trade as the knock-off. Knock-off artists ''take a good idea and flog it to death within a season, as opposed to appreciating quality, providing longer life and supporting designers,'' Scott Crolla says. But, as the Case of the Cabbage Roses indicates, some designers and many manufacturers, support themselves by knocking off, or adapting, existing designs.","abstract":null,"print_page":"12","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"PURLOINED SWEATER: A CASE OF WHO COPIED WHOM FIRST"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"GAULTIER, JEAN-PAUL"},{"name":"organizations","value":"CROLLA"},{"name":"subject","value":"DESIGN"},{"name":"subject","value":"SWEATERS"},{"name":"subject","value":"APPAREL"}],"pub_date":"1985-12-17T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Style Desk","section_name":"Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Michael","rank":1,"lastname":"GROSS"}],"original":"By MICHAEL GROSS"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd15f208eb7c8105d647ef4","word_count":1530},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1985\/12\/18\/world\/after-30-years-guatemala-tests-democracy.html","snippet":"Just five years ago, Francisco Villagran Kramer resigned his post as Vice President of Guatemala and fled the country.

''Death or exile is the fate of those who fight for justice in Guatemala,'' he said at the time. Today, Mr. Villagran's apartment in the capital is a gathering place for young activists eager to discuss what the future holds for Guatemalan democracy. He himself is said to be a possible candidate to head the Supreme Court. The military has run Guatemala for more than 30 years, and during that period Guatemalans have suffered some of the harshest repression in Latin America. Tens of thousands of people, many of them Indians descended from Mayan tribes, have died violently. During some periods, street-corner killings of students, businessmen, political organizers, university professors and trade unionists were common.","abstract":null,"print_page":"1","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"AFTER 30 YEARS, GUATEMALA TESTS DEMOCRACY"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"BUSH, GEORGE"},{"name":"persons","value":"CEREZO AREVALO, MARCO VINICIO"},{"name":"glocations","value":"GUATEMALA"},{"name":"organizations","value":"CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY"},{"name":"subject","value":"UNITED STATES INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS"},{"name":"subject","value":"INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS"},{"name":"subject","value":"ARMAMENT, DEFENSE AND MILITARY FORCES"},{"name":"subject","value":"POLITICS AND GOVERNMENT (1983)"},{"name":"subject","value":"ELECTIONS"}],"pub_date":"1985-12-18T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Foreign Desk","section_name":"World; Front Page; Washington","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Stephen","rank":1,"lastname":"KINZER"},{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":2}],"original":"By STEPHEN KINZER, Special to the New York Times"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd15fd48eb7c8105d648d7a","word_count":1743},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1985\/12\/18\/business\/latin-america-debtors-urge-loan-rate-cut.html","snippet":"Latin America's leading debtor nations today proposed a set of ''emergency measures,'' including new loans and the reduction of interest rates, to permit a resumption of economic growth in the region.
