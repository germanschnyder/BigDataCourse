The talks continued unexpectedly into the early morning hours with no decisions anticipated until later today. The weekend discussions, involving Foreign Ministers from five Central American nations and from eight countries involved in what is known as the Contadora peace process, centered on security guarantees and on United States assistance to Nicaraguan rebels, according to several negotiators. Officials said Nicaragua was demanding that the Contadora group condemn the Reagan Administration's effort to provide new funds to the Nicaraguan rebels and that the negotiators call for direct talks between the United States and Nicaragua.","abstract":null,"print_page":"4","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"NEGOTIATORS TRY TO END IMPASSE ON A CENTRAL AMERICA TREATY"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"LATIN AMERICA"},{"name":"glocations","value":"PANAMA"},{"name":"organizations","value":"CONTADORA GROUP"},{"name":"subject","value":"INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS"},{"name":"subject","value":"TREATIES"},{"name":"subject","value":"CIVIL WAR AND GUERRILLA WARFARE"},{"name":"subject","value":"CONVENTIONS AND CONFERENCES"}],"pub_date":"1986-04-07T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Foreign Desk","section_name":"World","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"James","rank":1,"lastname":"LeMOYNE"},{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":2}],"original":"By JAMES LeMOYNE, Special to the New York Times"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd15a498eb7c8105d63f4c3","word_count":911},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1986\/04\/08\/style\/in-fashion-some-promising-new-talent.html","snippet":"''For the past two years, we feel we have been pushing a very heavy load up a very steep hill,'' Christian Knaust said.

The two - Mr. Knaust is 36 years old and Mr. Andersson 42 - are among the promising new faces who will be showing their new collections when the New York fall and winter fashion showings open at the end of this month. What they all have in common is the belief that they have something fresh to offer, a new slant on how women can dress. Each hopes to make it into the big time.","abstract":null,"print_page":"5","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"IN FASHION, SOME PROMISING NEW TALENT"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"NEW YORK CITY"},{"name":"subject","value":"SHOWS (EXHIBITS)"},{"name":"subject","value":"APPAREL"}],"pub_date":"1986-04-08T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Style Desk","section_name":"Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Bernadine","rank":1,"lastname":"MORRIS"}],"original":"By BERNADINE MORRIS"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd15bd78eb7c8105d6422ae","word_count":823},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1986\/04\/08\/world\/latin-peace-talks-end-in-wrangling.html","snippet":"After three days of at times heated discussions, negotiations to find a settlement to the conflicts of Central America broke up here this afternoon in a cloud of recriminations without any formal agreements being reached.

In a disappointing end to what had been heralded as a major meeting of the so-called Contadora Group of Latin American countries, a string of Central American foreign ministers left Panama City exchanging condemnations for having failed to achieve concrete results. Representatives from El Salvador, Costa Rica and Honduras blamed Nicaragua for the breakdown in discussions, contending it had torpedoed hopes for peace by failing to sign a compromise agreement obligating all Central American countries to sign a final peace treaty by June 6.","abstract":null,"print_page":"4","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"LATIN PEACE TALKS END IN WRANGLING"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"LATIN AMERICA"},{"name":"glocations","value":"PANAMA"},{"name":"organizations","value":"CONTADORA GROUP"},{"name":"subject","value":"INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS"},{"name":"subject","value":"CIVIL WAR AND GUERRILLA WARFARE"}],"pub_date":"1986-04-08T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Foreign Desk","section_name":"World","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"James","rank":1,"lastname":"LeMOYNE"},{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":2}],"original":"By JAMES LeMOYNE, Special to the New York Times"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd154f68eb7c8105d638865","word_count":346},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1986\/04\/08\/nyregion\/22-tall-ships-accept-bid-to-lead-parade-on-july-4.html","snippet":"Twenty-two of the world's tallest sailing ships have so far accepted the invitation to lead the parade of ships up the Hudson River on July 4 for the Statue of Liberty centennial.

It is a reaction that runs against the instinctive optimism of a country where a talent for soccer is acquired as a birthright and where success in the game forms part of the national identity. It is also one that has withstood a fierce barrage of soccer-related television advertising aimed at generating excitement - and profits - before Brazil's 11 best players meet Spain's team in their first-round game June 1. Yet, although Brazilian fans are, as always, ready, willing and able to do their patriotic bit by praying and cheering, crying and dancing, there is a problem: The national team has yet to demonstrate that it deserves their support.","abstract":null,"print_page":"11","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"OUTLOOK IS SHAKY FOR A TRADITIONAL SOCCER POWER"},"keywords":[{"name":"creative_works","value":"WORLD CUP (SOCCER)"},{"name":"glocations","value":"BRAZIL"},{"name":"subject","value":"SURVEYS AND SERIES"},{"name":"subject","value":"SOCCER"}],"pub_date":"1986-04-16T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Sports Desk","section_name":"Sports","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Alan","rank":1,"lastname":"RIDING"},{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":2}],"original":"By ALAN RIDING, Special to the New York Times"},"type_of_material":"Series","_id":"4fd15a578eb7c8105d63fe68","word_count":1097},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1986\/04\/19\/sports\/sports-news-briefs-us-yacht-leads-in-global-race.html","snippet":"With 4,300 miles to go, the United States maxiyacht Atlantic Privateer sped past U.B.S.

His small, excavated, sometimes inhabited slabs of stone are less conceptual than the miniature cities and sites of Anne and Patrick Porier. They do not have the sexual and political edge that Charles Simonds has been trying to build into his erupting mounds. At the age of 64, Fonseca is considerably older than other sculptors involved in some way with ancient places and times. Since he was born in Montevideo, Uruguay, the archeological imagination is rooted in the world he grew up with. His sculpture is something of a search, an attempt to carve and hollow out an artistic stratum where the South America he left in 1950 and the North American and European worlds he has lived in since can join together. The exhibition at the Arnold Herstand Gallery, 24 West 57th Street, through May 31, is the first Fonseca has had in New York since 1971. There are 17 works, which is too many. The theatrical lighting also makes these upright objects on bases look like display cases in Tiffany's. Nevertheless, the strength of the artist's work - as well as his tendency to do a little too much, or to let his work become a bit too finicky - is clear.","abstract":null,"print_page":"32","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"ART: FONSECA'S ARCHEOLOGICAL SCULPTURE"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"FONSECA, GONZALO"},{"name":"subject","value":"REVIEWS"},{"name":"subject","value":"ART SHOWS"},{"name":"subject","value":"ART"}],"pub_date":"1986-05-02T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Weekend Desk","section_name":"Arts","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Michael","rank":1,"lastname":"BRENSON"}],"original":"By MICHAEL BRENSON"},"type_of_material":"Review","_id":"4fd1700a8eb7c8105d662839","word_count":1430},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1986\/05\/08\/business\/mixed-end-of-summit.html","snippet":"It is at least conceivable that the summit conference this week planted seeds that will change the economy of the world.
