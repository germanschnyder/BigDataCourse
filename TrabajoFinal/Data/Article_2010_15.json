Uruguay has won the tournament twice - in 1930 and 1950 - but has not reached this stage in 40 years. The Netherlands, famed for decades for elegant play, reached consecutive finals in 1974 and 1978 but has never won the Cup. Diego Forl\u00e1n and Luis Su\u00e1rez have led Uruguay with three goals each, but Su\u00e1rez is unavailable for this match; his intentional goal-line handball - cynical or brilliant, depending on your view - saved his team in the dying seconds of regulation time against Ghana but earned him a red card and a one-game suspension. The gritty play of Mark van Bommel in the Netherlands' midfield gives Robin van Persie, Arjen Robben and Wesley Sneijder the freedom to attack.
