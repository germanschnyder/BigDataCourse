A statement from the skipper, Nance Frank, cited lack of money as the reason for the yacht's withdrawal, although the entry was also said to have been troubled by disharmony among its 12-woman crew. On Thursday, the navigator, Adrienne Cahalan, of Australia, and the watch leader, Mikaela von Koskull of Finland, left the team. Their departure deprived Challenge of two of its most experienced sailors. Challenge finished 11th among the 14 yachts in the first leg, from Southampton, England, to Punta del Este, Uruguay. The boat was slowed by numerous technical problems, including a split mainsail and hardware and electronics failures.

But this week Jean Chretien, the Prime Minister-elect, resurrected the threat. That's unfortunate, because renegotiation could bury Nafta -- an important pact that would raise living standards in Canada, Mexico and the U.S. and lock Mexico into its pro-market reforms. The threat is also unnecessary, because Nafta doesn't bear on the trade issues that disturb Mr. Chretien the most. The dispute is mostly about subsidies the Canadian Government gives industries like wheat and lumber. These subsidies are designed to solve domestic problems, like bailing out flagging industries and developing downtrodden regions. But the two countries' economies are so intertwined that domestic subsidies inevitably affect trade between them. Subsidies help Canadian producers lower their prices, giving exporters an \"unfair advantage,\" according to their U.S. competitors.","abstract":null,"print_page":"20","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Canada's Quarrel With Nafta"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"CHRETIEN, JEAN"},{"name":"glocations","value":"CANADA"},{"name":"glocations","value":"MEXICO"},{"name":"subject","value":"NORTH AMERICAN FREE TRADE AGREEMENT"},{"name":"subject","value":"INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND WORLD MARKET"},{"name":"subject","value":"EDITORIALS"}],"pub_date":"1993-10-30T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Editorial Desk","section_name":"Opinion","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"Editorial","_id":"4fd1e9dd8eb7c8105d7385cf","word_count":397},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1993\/10\/31\/business\/at-work-want-to-survive-learn-to-negotiate.html","snippet":"SO, Bunky, you're depressed because the economy's dragging, your company's melting away, you've got a hefty mortgage, a Volvo with a bad case of the Swedish flu and a gaggle of orthodontia-bait kids?

Argentina and Australia are the only two nations to be involved in a playoff between countries from different continents. Argentina has the advantage because it scored a goal in Sydney on Oct. 31 in the first game of the home-and-home series, which ended in a 1-1 tie. The tie breaker is away goals; thus, a deadlock at 2-2 or more would advance Australia.

But over the past two months, President Clinton has pushed fellow Democrats to embrace the North American Free Trade Agreement. He's bucked organized labor and rejected the advice of some of his closest advisers -- who cautioned that the price of victory would be too steep. Staking his reputation on the outcome of tonight's vote in the House, he's done what a President is supposed to do when issues are tough and the public is evenly divided: Lead. The question now is whether a Democratic Congress will vote its conscience or its fears. A no vote wouldn't bury the Clinton Presidency. But it would cast doubt on his and his party's ability to govern. It would also undermine Mr. Clinton's credibility abroad, just as the all-important Uruguay Round of international trade talks is drawing to a close. Beyond that, it could send a devastating signal about America's appetite for global leadership after the cold war. That is what the Nafta vote is ultimately about: whether the country is willing to move forward or retreat into economic isolation.","abstract":null,"print_page":"26","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Nafta and the National Interest"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"CANADA"},{"name":"glocations","value":"UNITED STATES"},{"name":"glocations","value":"MEXICO"},{"name":"subject","value":"NORTH AMERICAN FREE TRADE AGREEMENT"},{"name":"subject","value":"INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND WORLD MARKET"},{"name":"subject","value":"EDITORIALS"},{"name":"subject","value":"TREATIES"}],"pub_date":"1993-11-17T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Editorial Desk","section_name":"Opinion","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"Editorial","_id":"4fd1e9f18eb7c8105d73904a","word_count":421}]},"status":"OK","copyright":"Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
