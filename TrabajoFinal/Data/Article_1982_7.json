In that event, British analysts said, the expected elimination of Argentine military power on the Falkland Islands would not end the conflict but would usher in a period of hit-and-run warfare by air and sea in which the islands' British garrison and supply lines would be under constant attack. Although British officials do not believe that additional weapons can prevent an eventual British victory in the war, they fear that their delivery to Argentina would insure continuation of the conflict. Strikes by Argentine aircraft armed with Gabriel or Exocet missiles from bases on the mainland, one official said, might force London to reconsider the question of British air attacks on bases in Argentina. Such attacks are now forbidden.","abstract":null,"print_page":"13","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"BRITISH SAY NEW ARMS FOR ARGENTINA WOULD MEAN LONG, HIT-AND-RUN WAR","kicker":"MILITARY ANALYSIS"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"FALKLAND ISLANDS"},{"name":"glocations","value":"GREAT BRITAIN"},{"name":"glocations","value":"ARGENTINA"},{"name":"glocations","value":"ISRAEL, STATE OF"},{"name":"subject","value":"INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS"},{"name":"subject","value":"ARMAMENT, DEFENSE AND MILITARY FORCES"},{"name":"subject","value":"BOUNDARIES AND TERRITORIAL ISSUES"},{"name":"subject","value":"MILITARY EQUIPMENT"},{"name":"subject","value":"FOREIGN AID"}],"pub_date":"1982-06-06T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Foreign Desk","section_name":"World","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Drew","rank":1,"lastname":"MIDDLETON"},{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":2}],"original":"By DREW MIDDLETON, Special to the New York Times"},"type_of_material":"An Analysis","_id":"4fd135758eb7c8105d60697c","word_count":995},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1982\/06\/07\/world\/argentines-expect-assault-by-the-british-at-any-time.html","snippet":"Argentina said today that its planes and artillery bombarded British positions surrounding the besieged Falkland Islands' garrison at Stanley.

The fighting was otherwise minimal in what one military spokesman said was ''the calm before the great battle.'' Senior Argentine military officers said they expected the British to launch a major assault on the more than 7,000-man garrison at any moment. The joint military command said in a communique this afternoon that Argentine planes continued their nightly bombing runs in an ''offensive reconnaissance'' of British emplacements early this morning. The raids were most likely carried out by the air force's squadron of nine Canberra light tactical bombers, military officers said.","abstract":null,"print_page":"6","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"ARGENTINES EXPECT ASSAULT BY THE BRITISH AT ANY TIME"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"FALKLAND ISLANDS"},{"name":"glocations","value":"GREAT BRITAIN"},{"name":"glocations","value":"ARGENTINA"},{"name":"subject","value":"INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS"},{"name":"subject","value":"ARMAMENT, DEFENSE AND MILITARY FORCES"},{"name":"subject","value":"BOUNDARIES AND TERRITORIAL ISSUES"},{"name":"subject","value":"MILITARY ACTION"}],"pub_date":"1982-06-07T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Foreign Desk","section_name":"World","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Edward","rank":1,"lastname":"SCHUMACHER"},{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":2}],"original":"By EDWARD SCHUMACHER, Special to the New York Times"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd123f18eb7c8105d5e8333","word_count":730},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1982\/06\/08\/world\/latins-weigh-war-s-effects-news-analysis.html","snippet":"South American leaders are already taking steps and anxiously pondering others to adjust to the conditions they believe will face the continent in the aftermath of the Falkland Island crisis.

The principal perception motivating them is that the United States can no longer be trusted as a fully reliable ally and that they must strengthen their own defenses and build more regional cooperation as a result. That feeling appears to have enough force to survive any outcome. An Argentine defeat would almost certainly serve to broaden the effects of the war on the area.","abstract":null,"print_page":"9","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"News Analysis","kicker":"LATINS WEIGH WAR'S EFFECTS"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"FALKLAND ISLANDS"},{"name":"glocations","value":"GREAT BRITAIN"},{"name":"glocations","value":"LATIN AMERICA"},{"name":"glocations","value":"ARGENTINA"},{"name":"subject","value":"INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS"},{"name":"subject","value":"BOUNDARIES AND TERRITORIAL ISSUES"}],"pub_date":"1982-06-08T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Foreign Desk","section_name":"World","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Warren","rank":1,"lastname":"HOGE"},{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":2}],"original":"By WARREN HOGE, Special to the New York Times"},"type_of_material":"An Analysis","_id":"4fd1258a8eb7c8105d5eb40c","word_count":869},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1982\/06\/08\/world\/argentina-reports-retreat-by-british-in-clash.html","snippet":"Argentina sought to keep an optimistic tone today as it awaited a British assault against Stanley, the capital of the Falkland Islands.

There was no confirmation here of reports by correspondents with British forces that the British had seized high ground north of the Stanley airfield cutting off supply to the Argentines. A communique tonight said that the Argentines had battled British troops near Mount Kent, west of Stanley, forcing them to abandon equipment, and that an incursion by British Harrier jets had been repelled. Tonight's communique was similar to one issued this morning, which said reconnaissance forces had battled British troops west of Stanley, forcing them to ''retreat, abandoning equipment that proved the presence of troops from the 42d Commando Unit of the Marine Infantry.'' It said Argentine troops had ''observed enemy vehicles bogged down and without occupants in the zone of Mount Fitzroy.''","abstract":null,"print_page":"7","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"ARGENTINA REPORTS RETREAT BY BRITISH IN CLASH"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"FALKLAND ISLANDS"},{"name":"glocations","value":"STANLEY (FALKLAND ISLANDS)"},{"name":"glocations","value":"GREAT BRITAIN"},{"name":"glocations","value":"ARGENTINA"},{"name":"subject","value":"ARMAMENT, DEFENSE AND MILITARY FORCES"},{"name":"subject","value":"INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS"},{"name":"subject","value":"BOUNDARIES AND TERRITORIAL ISSUES"},{"name":"subject","value":"MILITARY ACTION"}],"pub_date":"1982-06-08T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Foreign Desk","section_name":"World","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"firstname":"Richard","middlename":"J.","lastname":"MEISLIN","rank":1,"role":"reported","organization":""}],"original":"By RICHARD J.
