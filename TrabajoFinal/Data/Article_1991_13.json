Jones, chief economist of Aubrey G. Lanston & Company, says this slump is distinguished from its postwar predecessors by a clash between a dangerously overleveraged economy and unusually severe bank loan stringency. \"The threat posed is an all-out private-sector credit contraction and asset price deflation, accompanied by mounting corporate bankruptcies and bank failures,\" he said. \"The resulting decline in consumer wealth could curtail spending for a prolonged period.\"","abstract":null,"print_page":"2","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Economic Scene; What's Different About This Slump"},"keywords":[{"name":"subject","value":"RECESSION AND DEPRESSION"},{"name":"subject","value":"UNITED STATES ECONOMY"},{"name":"subject","value":"GREAT DEPRESSION (1930'S)"}],"pub_date":"1991-12-27T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Financial Desk","section_name":"Business","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Leonard","rank":1,"lastname":"Silk"}],"original":"By Leonard Silk"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd1d4558eb7c8105d71152d","word_count":809},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1991\/12\/30\/nyregion\/man-charged-in-the-killing-of-an-officer.html","snippet":"A 25-year-old man with a record of six felony arrests and a long string of drug and fare-beating convictions was charged yesterday with killing an off-duty police officer who had tried to foil a robbery at a cash machine early Saturday.

The police said the man, Christopher Lewis of 71 West 128th Street, has been arrested 35 times and convicted 26 times. Six of the arrests were for unspecified felonies and 29 were for misdemeanors, including 10 narcotics arrests. Most of the other misdemeanor arrests were for fare beating, and Mr. Lewis was wanted on a bench warrant on such a charge.","abstract":null,"print_page":"1","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Man Charged In the Killing Of an Officer"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"LEWIS, CHRISTOPHER"},{"name":"persons","value":"DINKINS, DAVID N"},{"name":"glocations","value":"NEW YORK CITY"},{"name":"subject","value":"ROBBERIES AND THEFTS"},{"name":"subject","value":"ATTACKS ON POLICE"},{"name":"subject","value":"MURDERS AND ATTEMPTED MURDERS"},{"name":"subject","value":"AUTOMATIC TELLER MACHINES (ATM)"},{"name":"subject","value":"POLICE"}],"pub_date":"1991-12-30T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Metropolitan Desk","section_name":"New York and Region","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd1ca1d8eb7c8105d6fdce1","word_count":805},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1991\/12\/31\/opinion\/distorted-diplomacy-on-japan.html","snippet":"President Bush belatedly set off for Asia yesterday, taking along the chiefs of 21 major American corporations, including the Big Three auto makers.

Regrettably, Mr. Bush seems to be leaving his own best foreign policy instincts and free trade principles behind. Originally, this trip to Australia, Singapore, South Korea and Japan was meant to revitalize key Asia-Pacific alliances for the post-cold-war era. But domestic political concerns brought a panicky postponement, and then a hasty recasting of the trip as a Japan-bashing crusade for American jobs.","abstract":null,"print_page":"20","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Distorted Diplomacy on Japan"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"BUSH, GEORGE"},{"name":"glocations","value":"JAPAN"},{"name":"glocations","value":"FAR EAST, SOUTH AND SOUTHEAST ASIA AND PACIFIC AREAS"},{"name":"subject","value":"JAPAN-INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS-US"},{"name":"subject","value":"UNITED STATES INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS"},{"name":"subject","value":"INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS"},{"name":"subject","value":"INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND WORLD MARKET"}],"pub_date":"1991-12-31T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Editorial Desk","section_name":"Opinion","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"Editorial","_id":"4fd19c458eb7c8105d6ada08","word_count":428}]},"status":"OK","copyright":"Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
