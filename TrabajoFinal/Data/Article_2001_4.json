After being mired for a year after the Seattle debacle, the trade-round juggernaut began to gather speed again early in the year when Pascal Lamy, the European Union's trade commissioner, spoke strongly in favor of starting a new round at the World Trade Organization's next ministerial meeting, to be held in November in Doha, Qatar. In May, President Bush declared free trade a ''moral imperative,'' and the United States trade representative, Robert Zoellick, promoted the idea on a subsequent swing through Europe.","abstract":"Diplomatic momentum is gathering behind new round of global trade talks when World Trade Organization holds its next ministerial meeting in November in Doha, Qatar, but prospects for talks are clouded by fundamental differences between rich and poor nations and US and its trading partners over what should be on agenda; divisions follow pattern that was evident before failed Seattle meeting in December 1999; group's new head, Mike Moore, is trying to reconcile competing views; photo (M)","print_page":"1","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Seattle Failure Weighs on Future of New Trade Talks"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"MOORE, MIKE"},{"name":"glocations","value":"DOHA (QATAR)"},{"name":"glocations","value":"SEATTLE (WASH)"},{"name":"organizations","value":"WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION"},{"name":"subject","value":"INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND WORLD MARKET"}],"pub_date":"2001-06-26T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Business\/Financial Desk","section_name":"Business","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Elizabeth","rank":1,"lastname":"OLSON"}],"original":"By ELIZABETH OLSON"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd249e68eb7c8105d7e7528","word_count":781},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2001\/07\/02\/sports\/plus-soccer-two-more-gain-world-cup-berths.html","snippet":"Cameroon and South Africa yesterday qualified for berths in next year's World Cup, and four-time champion Brazil stumbled again, losing by 1-0 at Uruguay.
