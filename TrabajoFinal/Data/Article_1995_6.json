But the lifelong guerrilla commander's instinctive answer to the latest peace offer by Colombia's President was bombs and bullets. When President Ernesto Samper Pizano unveiled a peace plan in May, Mr. Marulanda and other guerrilla leaders responded with an offensive that killed 157 people and wounded hundreds. Guerrillas kidnapped 35 people, blew up oil pipelines seven times, exploded a bomb in Colombia's Congress building, and destroyed a peace statue created by Fernando Botero, the father of Colombia's Defense Minister.","abstract":null,"print_page":"1","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Colombia's Rebels Grow Rich From Banditry"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"COLOMBIA"},{"name":"subject","value":"ROBBERIES AND THEFTS"},{"name":"subject","value":"KIDNAPPING"},{"name":"subject","value":"CIVIL WAR AND GUERRILLA WARFARE"},{"name":"subject","value":"EXTORTION AND BLACKMAIL"},{"name":"subject","value":"CRIME AND CRIMINALS"},{"name":"subject","value":"DRUG ABUSE AND TRAFFIC"}],"pub_date":"1995-07-02T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Foreign Desk","section_name":"World","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"James","rank":1,"lastname":"BROOKE"}],"original":"By JAMES BROOKE"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd2004c8eb7c8105d76329d","word_count":1417},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1995\/07\/04\/business\/international-business-more-open-latin-borders-mirror-region-s-freer-markets.html","snippet":"Latin America's free-trade mood, though overshadowed by the Mexican financial crisis and war between Peru and Ecuador, is expansive, reflected best perhaps by the new express lanes at Brazil's international airports.

Competing for the first time at Olympic Stadium, Mutola was timed in 2 minutes 30.72 seconds, just 5-hundredths of a second off the world record. It was the second fastest time ever in the seldom-contested distance, which is not on any championship schedule. Regina Jacobs of the United States finished second in 2:35.46. Johnson, ranked No. 1 in the world at 200 and 400 meters, took the 200 in a fast 20.15 in slight head wind after easing up near the finish. (AP) TENNIS Muster Streak Stopped Top-seeded Thomas Muster had his 40-match winning streak on clay ended yesterday when he was beaten in the first round of the $560,000 Swiss Open tournament in Gstaad, Sweden. Alex Corretja of Spain took only 90 minutes to beat Muster, 7-5, 6-1. (AP) SOCCER Brazil Advances, 2-0 In Rivera, Uruguay, World Cup champion Brazil, bidding for its fifth America Cup title, scored two late goals last night to beat Peru, 2-0, and qualify for the second round. Brazil scored in the 77th minute on a penalty kick by Zinho. Six minutes later Edmundo took advantage of a rebound off Peruvian goalkeeper Miguel Miranda to score. The Brazilians joined Uruguay in the second round of the 12-nation championships. Earlier last night, Colombia beat Ecuador, 1-0, to move closer to the second round. Ecuador was virtually eliminated after its second straight loss. The United States, which beat Chile in its opener, plays tonight.
