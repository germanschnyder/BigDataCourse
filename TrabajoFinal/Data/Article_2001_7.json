Maybe some brushwork, maybe not. That's about it. You can do what you want with the results. You can treat a picture as a window onto something (open sky, inner space). Or as a physical object with texture and weight. Or, if you know a little history, as a utopian gesture, a chunk of the social sublime. Abstraction has been around so long now, though, that it's hard to remember how radical it felt when it was new, what it demanded of an audience in terms of faith and flexibility and, if you got it, how stimulating it could be.

Museums ''ABSTRACT ART FROM THE R\u00cdO DE LA PLATA: BUENOS AIRES AND MONTEVIDEO, 1933-1953,'' Americas Society, 680 Park Avenue, at 68th Street, (212) 249-8950 (through Dec. 9). Buenos Aires and Montevideo, respectively the capitals of Argentina and Uruguay, are in the very south of South America, a long way from the hot-spots of early Modernism in Europe and the United States. Yet in the 1930's and 40's, these two cosmopolitan cities were lively environments for forward-looking artists. Several are in this tangy exhibition, beginning with the tutelary figure of Joaqu\u00edn Torres-Garc\u00eda, a native Uruguayan. And whether following his example or running in the opposite direction, issuing public manifestos or working away in private, his younger colleagues suggest what an audacious experiment in alternative reality abstraction has always been. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, noon to 6 p.m. Free (Holland Cotter).","abstract":null,"print_page":"32","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"ART GUIDE"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"2001-10-05T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Leisure\/Weekend Desk","section_name":"Arts","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"Schedule","_id":"4fd218198eb7c8105d79441f","word_count":4350},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2001\/10\/08\/sports\/plus-soccer-china-qualifiesfor-first-world-cup.html","snippet":"Bora Milutinovic has done it again -- this time with China, which will be playing in its first World Cup.

He stood in the doorway of the Dunkin' Donuts here at 5:30 Monday morning, huddled against the cold, waiting for a boss who spoke no Spanish, whose name he did not know, a big gringo with blond hair in a Chevy Suburban, coming to pick him up for a day's work at a construction site. At first, the young man said he was in America legally, then he said he could not give his whole name because he feared deportation. His dream? Marry an American girl and get legal fast. ''Of course I feel like an outsider,'' he said, standing on the quiet suburban street. ''Me siento solo'' (I feel alone). For years, up to 50 Hispanic men a day have appeared in front of Dunkin' Donuts hoping to be chosen for off-the-books day labor jobs in landscaping, demolition, construction. But on Monday morning, for the first time, these men were invited inside by Dover officials to a new day laborers' center, where they could stay warm, get free coffee, wait for the bosses and learn about health and housing benefits they can qualify for.

It starts out as a stylish, convoluted caper film in which a gang is assembled for a big score that doesn't go quite as smoothly as planned. The heist involves a disgraced tango singer, a crooked government official and an assortment of underworld types, but the movie's real focus is on the three younger members: Cuervo (Pablo Echarri), the girl-crazy, drug-addled getaway driver, and Angel (Eduardo Noriega) and Nene (Leonardo Sbaraglia), gay lovers known in criminal circles as the twins.","abstract":null,"print_page":"29","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"'Burnt Money'","kicker":"FILM IN REVIEW"},"keywords":[{"name":"creative_works","value":"BURNT MONEY (MOVIE)"},{"name":"subject","value":"MOTIONS PICTURES, REVIEWS"}],"pub_date":"2001-10-19T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Movies, Performing Arts\/Weekend Desk","section_name":"Movies; Arts","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"firstname":"A.","middlename":"O.","lastname":"SCOTT","rank":1,"role":"reported","organization":""}],"original":"By A.
