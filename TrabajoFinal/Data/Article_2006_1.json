Sure, there are plenty of Mediterranean and Caribbean sailings this summer, but cruise lines are also sending more ships to Northern Europe (where you can, for instance, see the Baroque Catherine Palace, just outside St. Petersburg) and increasing capacity in Alaska (where you can take a ride on the White Pass & Yukon Route Railroad, a relic of the 1898 gold rush). There are excursions that whisk passengers farther and farther away from the ship (Antarctica, anyone?) and cruises that stop in far-flung ports in the Middle East and Asia, for those who want to mix, say, a little archaeology with their rest and recreation.

In Buenos Aires, fans still place lighted cigarettes between the fingers of his statue, and such is his popularity that Gardel is claimed by Argentina, Uruguay and France as one of their own. Now he is being co-opted by the fashion world, turning up as a reference on the runway of Kris Van Assche (inset below). ''Carlos Gardel is the iconic representation of everything I like about Argentina: the attitude, the pride in tango, the almost sacred ritual of dressing up,'' Van Assche says. Gardel's signature accessories were his tie, wide-brimmed hat and cigarette (not so well known was his alleged proclivity for man-girdles, stacked heels and plastic surgery). Van Assche doffed his cap to the master's rakish style by sending out T-shirts printed with Gardel's image and by ''sublimating the elegance and refinement of lost days.'' But if you want to move like Gardel, Dance Manhattan (212-807-0802) and DanceSport (212-307-1111) offer tango lessons for aspiring Latin loffers.
