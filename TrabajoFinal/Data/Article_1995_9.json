This time the spotlight is on Ernesto Samper Pizano, President of Colombia, implicated by tape recordings and the testimony of former aides as the knowing beneficiary of $6 million in campaign donations from the Cali cocaine cartel. It is still much too early to tell whether Mr. Samper can survive the scandal, or whether, like Fernando Collor de Melo of Brazil and Carlos Andres Perez of Venezuela, he will eventually have to resign. But in any case, as the Brazilian magazine Veja put it, \"a strange epidemic seems to be devastating the presidential palaces of Latin America\" lately: Ecuador's Vice President resigned and fled the country this month because of a corruption investigation; Peru and Guatemala are seeking the extradition of former presidents to face criminal charges, and former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari of Mexico has had to take refuge in the United States amid inquiries into his tenure.","abstract":null,"print_page":"14","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"The New Latin Scandals Challenge Democracies","kicker":"THE WORLD"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"LATIN AMERICA"},{"name":"subject","value":"POLITICS AND GOVERNMENT"}],"pub_date":"1995-10-22T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Week in Review Desk","section_name":"Week in Review","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Larry","rank":1,"lastname":"ROHTER"}],"original":"By LARRY ROHTER"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd1eced8eb7c8105d73ed18","word_count":1135},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1995\/10\/25\/world\/the-un-at-50-up-close-a-wistful-little-land-savors-world-stage.html","snippet":"Just outside the fanfare that surrounded the United Nations with a womb of security on Sunday, the Foreign Minister from the tiny nation of Bhutan sat unnoticed at a booth in a coffee shop at 48th Street and First Avenue.

He had a cup of Lipton tea and no armed guard. Dawa Tsering, the Foreign Minister and the official representative of the world's last remaining Himalayan Buddhist kingdom, said he had not been able to meditate much during the weekend. Because King Jigme Singye Wangchuck, Precious Ruler of the Dragon People, had not made the trip to the 50th anniversary of the United Nations, the 60-year-old official had taken part in all the ceremonies and receptions and handshake lines.","abstract":null,"print_page":"12","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"A Wistful Little Land Savors World Stage","kicker":"THE U.N.

The countries -- Ecuador, Israel, Jordan, Peru and Venezuela -- got \"conditional\" ratings in the F.A.A.'s study of countries with airlines that fly to the United States. This means that airlines from these countries may continue limited operations into the United States, under more intense F.A.A. surveillance, while efforts continue to improve safety standards. The aviation agency's most recent report, on Nov. 2, said that five other countries -- Australia, Hungary, New Zealand, Romania and Western Samoa -- met the international standards set by the International Civil Aviation Organization, a United Nations agency. The F.A.A. judges on world standards, which are less stringent than the F.A.A.'s, which apply to United States airlines.","abstract":null,"print_page":"3","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Travel Advisory;F.A.A.
