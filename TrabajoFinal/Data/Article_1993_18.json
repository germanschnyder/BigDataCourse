The negotiations that began seven years ago in moderate obscurity have ended as a pivotal political event, engaging heads of state in discussions about rice and placing the likes of Steven Spielberg and Mario Vargas Llosa in heated debate about cultural values. Most fundamentally, this unlikely transformation reflects the collapse of the Iron Curtain. In a world no longer defined by military and ideological conflict, what counts for politicans are economic success and the creation of jobs. That is why President Clinton and Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany have been as involved in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade talks as their predecessors were in negotiations to station new missiles in Western Europe.","abstract":null,"print_page":"19","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"A Realignment Made Reluctantly","kicker":"THE WORLD TRADE AGREEMENT"},"keywords":[{"name":"creative_works","value":"GENERAL AGREEMENT ON TARIFFS AND TRADE (GATT)"},{"name":"organizations","value":"GENERAL AGREEMENT ON TARIFFS AND TRADE"},{"name":"subject","value":"INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND WORLD MARKET"},{"name":"subject","value":"URUGUAY ROUND (TRADE TALKS)"},{"name":"subject","value":"ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND TRENDS"}],"pub_date":"1993-12-15T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Financial Desk","section_name":"Business","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Roger","rank":1,"lastname":"COHEN"}],"original":"By ROGER COHEN"},"type_of_material":"An Analysis; News Analysis","_id":"4fd1bf1c8eb7c8105d6ecd61","word_count":1117},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1993\/12\/16\/business\/world-trade-agreement-hollywood-reaction-clinton-spared-blame-hollywood.html","snippet":"For weeks, Hollywood executives had insisted that President Clinton had assured them that American-made movies and television programs were, in the words of leaders here, \"a defining issue\" and \"make or break\" in world trade negotiations.

Today, a day after the entertainment industry emerged as a big loser in the agreement, industry leaders and others who agreed to speak publicly voiced disappointment but carefully avoided blaming the President for failing to abolish European protections that could potentially hold back the growth of American movies and television programs. Avoiding Short-Sightedness Several executives graciously said it would been financially, politically and diplomatically short-sighted for the Clinton Administration to sacrifice the overall agreement for the sake of Hollywood studios.

One is subtle, the other blunt. One is a committed free trader and a one-time protege of Margaret Thatcher; the other is a Los Angeles lawyer, willing to argue almost any position, who started in politics as an advocate of the dispossessed. But to an extraordinary extent, today's global trade pact is the product of the unusual friendship between Sir Leon Brittan, the Englishman who represented the European Community, and Mickey Kantor, who represented the United States. Frosty at First When they met 10 months ago, their relationship was frosty. That is not surprising, since one is the product of Cambridge University and Britain's traditionally aristocratic Tory Party and the other, folksier in style, started life in America's country-music capital, Nashville, and made his name as a wheeling-and-dealing entertainment lawyer.","abstract":null,"print_page":"8","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"THE WORLD TRADE AGREEMENT: The Negotiators; Odd Couple Bring a World Trade Accord Home"},"keywords":[{"name":"creative_works","value":"GENERAL AGREEMENT ON TARIFFS AND TRADE (GATT)"},{"name":"creative_works","value":"EUROPEAN COMMUNITY"},{"name":"persons","value":"KANTOR, MICKEY"},{"name":"persons","value":"BRITTAN, LEON"},{"name":"glocations","value":"EUROPE"},{"name":"glocations","value":"UNITED STATES"},{"name":"organizations","value":"EUROPEAN COMMUNITY"},{"name":"organizations","value":"GENERAL AGREEMENT ON TARIFFS AND TRADE"},{"name":"subject","value":"INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND WORLD MARKET"},{"name":"subject","value":"BIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION"},{"name":"subject","value":"URUGUAY ROUND (TRADE TALKS)"}],"pub_date":"1993-12-16T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Financial Desk","section_name":"Business","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Keith","rank":1,"lastname":"BRADSHER"}],"original":"By KEITH BRADSHER"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd1bdc08eb7c8105d6eaea0","word_count":623},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1993\/12\/16\/opinion\/after-seven-years-a-global-gift.html","snippet":"The trade agreement completed yesterday after seven tortuous years of negotiations among 117 countries is good for the U.S. and good for the world.

Its real importance lies less in its individual provisions than in its vibrant message; the world's trading partners have now pledged to keep marching relentlessly toward liberalized trade. And that, in turn, will bring higher living standards than any other government policy will. For the first time, agriculture, services, textiles and investment will be covered by international rules of fair trade. Tariffs and trade barriers will tumble. Those changes should drive down consumer prices on everything from clothing to computers. And lower prices will mean higher living standards, especially for the poor.","abstract":null,"print_page":"28","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"After Seven Years, a Global Gift"},"keywords":[{"name":"creative_works","value":"GENERAL AGREEMENT ON TARIFFS AND TRADE (GATT)"},{"name":"glocations","value":"UNITED STATES"},{"name":"organizations","value":"GENERAL AGREEMENT ON TARIFFS AND TRADE"},{"name":"subject","value":"INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND WORLD MARKET"},{"name":"subject","value":"EDITORIALS"},{"name":"subject","value":"PROTECTIONISM (TRADE)"},{"name":"subject","value":"ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND TRENDS"}],"pub_date":"1993-12-16T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Editorial Desk","section_name":"Opinion","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"Editorial","_id":"4fd1e9f08eb7c8105d738fde","word_count":529},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1993\/12\/16\/business\/world-trade-agreement-view-washington-clinton-some-congress-see-less-trouble.html","snippet":"President Clinton kicked off his campaign today to get the new world trade agreement approved by Congress, saying it would foster an American export boom and that it \"cements our position of leadership in the new global economy.\"   At a hastily...","lead_paragraph":"President Clinton kicked off his campaign today to get the new world trade agreement approved by Congress, saying it would foster an American export boom and that it \"cements our position of leadership in the new global economy.\" At a hastily called news conference at the White House, within minutes of the approval of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade accord in Geneva, Mr. Clinton said he was formally notifying Congress of his intention to sign the accord.

He reveled in American-style politics -- from teleprompters to polo shirts to brisk tennis games -- and promised to end Japan's political corruption and economic collusion. But after a blazing start, Mr. Hosokawa seems to be losing his magic touch. The programs on which he staked his leadership, reforming the political system and deregulating a languishing economy, have bogged down. Tokyo's back-room deal-making, which he denounced for years as Governor of a southern prefecture, is beginning to engulf him. Time and again in recent weeks he has struggled to keep ideological rifts between the Socialists and the seven other parties in his fragile coalition Cabinet from splitting the Government apart. So far it has held together, but at great political cost to Mr. Hosokawa. Motivated by Bitterness The bureaucrats who ran the country for four decades with the now-deposed Liberal Democratic Party snipe about the new Government's disorganization, whispering over lunch in Kasumigaseki, the Government center, that Mr. Hosokawa is proving himself a small-town politician. He is uninterested in foreign relations, they say, at sea when it comes to handling the economy, unwilling to delve into policy details. Editorialists have begun to complain that his Government is long on symbolism but short on action, too captivated by the example of another former Southern Governor across the Pacific.","abstract":null,"print_page":"1","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Japan's Promising New Leader Seems to Lose His Magic Touch"},"keywords":[{"name":"creative_works","value":"SOCIALIST PARTY (JAPAN)"},{"name":"persons","value":"HOSOKAWA, MORIHIRO"},{"name":"glocations","value":"JAPAN"},{"name":"organizations","value":"SOCIALIST PARTY"},{"name":"subject","value":"CABINETS AND SUB-CABINETS"},{"name":"subject","value":"INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS"},{"name":"subject","value":"REFORM AND REORGANIZATION"},{"name":"subject","value":"ETHICS"},{"name":"subject","value":"POLITICS AND GOVERNMENT"},{"name":"subject","value":"ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND TRENDS"},{"name":"subject","value":"REGULATION AND DEREGULATION OF INDUSTRY"}],"pub_date":"1993-12-20T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Foreign Desk","section_name":"World; Front Page","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"firstname":"David","middlename":"E.","lastname":"SANGER","rank":1,"role":"reported","organization":""}],"original":"By DAVID E.
