One ventured downtown because one had to, went the thinking of those citizens who didn't, and one did so at the risk of nausea, neurosis or worse. Beneath the brownish haze of pollution, however, Mexicans have begun to rediscover the center of a city that has an extraordinary history. Young artists and bohemians have moved into some of the decrepit colonial buildings, and a few wealthier residents have taken to restoring others. Politicians and power-bureaucrats have made the center's old restaurants fashionable again, and its museums and theaters are busier and busier.","abstract":null,"print_page":"10","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Mexico City","kicker":"WHAT'S DOING IN"},"keywords":[{"name":"creative_works","value":"WHAT'S DOING IN...(TIMES COLUMN)"},{"name":"glocations","value":"MEXICO CITY (MEX)"},{"name":"glocations","value":"MEXICO"},{"name":"subject","value":"NYTRAVEL"},{"name":"subject","value":"TRAVEL AND VACATIONS"}],"pub_date":"1993-02-28T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Travel Desk","section_name":"Travel","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1}],"original":"By TIM GOLDEN;"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd1db8e8eb7c8105d71c982","word_count":1696},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1993\/03\/05\/opinion\/trade-s-new-sheriff.html","snippet":"Both Clintons were on view last week.

Around the world, in a variety of cultures, farmers, especially family farmers, are prized as the ultimate custodians of national identity, of tradition and of the soil.

During the most violent spasms of the 12-year civil war in El Salvador, a cashiered National Guard officer named Roberto D'Aubuisson preferred to go on television to denounce people he considered subversive. Then they would be killed. So when an investigatory panel sponsored by the United Nations reported last week on the Salvadoran war's worst violence, most of its findings rang familiar. This Commission on the Truth was in some ways the culmination of the settlement that formally ended the conflict last December. For a country that grew so polarized while at center stage in the cold war that priests became military targets and Mr. D'Aubuisson nearly became president, the panel was meant in part to lay a basis for reconciliation. And in a land where power stemmed from both terror and deniability, it was also meant to provide a clearer sense of reality. But no sooner did the commission offer its conclusions than events in El Salvador began calling into question what effect even an impartial, internationally sanctioned view of the past can have on hatreds so impacted.","abstract":null,"print_page":"1","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Can the Truth Help Salvador Outlive Hate?"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"EL SALVADOR"},{"name":"subject","value":"ATROCITIES"},{"name":"subject","value":"POLITICS AND GOVERNMENT"},{"name":"subject","value":"CIVIL WAR AND GUERRILLA WARFARE"}],"pub_date":"1993-03-21T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Week in Review Desk","section_name":"Week in Review","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Tim","rank":1,"lastname":"GOLDEN"}],"original":"By TIM GOLDEN"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd1a5558eb7c8105d6be4be","word_count":1161},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1993\/03\/27\/business\/us-calls-on-japan-to-set-trade-goals.html","snippet":"The Clinton Administration asked Japan today to set specific figures for how much in foreign goods and services it plans to buy as part of a fiscal stimulus package.
