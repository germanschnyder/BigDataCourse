Despite resistance to his return by much of Haiti's narrow political elite, and disturbing allegations about his style of rule, the entire hemisphere has a stake in his return. What's at stake is not Mr. Aristide's personal franchise but constitutional legitimacy, a principle not yet secure in nations like Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Peru, Uruguay or Paraguay. All have recently liberated themselves from long periods of military rule. But all suffer from economic and social problems that make them vulnerable to military pressure.","abstract":null,"print_page":"32","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"For Haiti: The Essential First Step"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"ARISTIDE, JEAN-BERTRAND"},{"name":"glocations","value":"HAITI"},{"name":"subject","value":"COUPS D'ETAT AND ATTEMPTED COUPS D'ETAT"},{"name":"subject","value":"UNITED STATES INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS"},{"name":"subject","value":"ARMAMENT, DEFENSE AND MILITARY FORCES"},{"name":"subject","value":"EDITORIALS"}],"pub_date":"1991-10-25T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Editorial Desk","section_name":"Opinion","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"Editorial","_id":"4fd1c4b18eb7c8105d6f4b86","word_count":377},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1991\/11\/05\/business\/2-democrats-seek-tough-trade-policy.html","snippet":"Reviving a fiercely debated issue from the 1988 Presidential campaign, two Democratic members of the House introduced legislation this afternoon that calls for trade sanctions against countries that unfairly exclude American exports and run trade...","lead_paragraph":"Reviving a fiercely debated issue from the 1988 Presidential campaign, two Democratic members of the House introduced legislation this afternoon that calls for trade sanctions against countries that unfairly exclude American exports and run trade surpluses with the United States.

The site was Seoul, where the 15 nations that make up Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation met to add momentum, very carefully, to the two-year-old body. For the first time, the members -- Japan, China and other East Asian countries, the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand -- agreed to create a permanent secretariat and a budget for 10 modest projects that would promote regional cooperation and growth.","abstract":null,"print_page":"5","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"A Wary Step Toward Regional Cooperation","kicker":"THE WORLD"},"keywords":[{"name":"organizations","value":"ASIA PACIFIC ECONOMIC COOPERATION"}],"pub_date":"1991-11-17T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Week in Review Desk","section_name":"Week in Review","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"James","rank":1,"lastname":"STERNGOLD"}],"original":"By JAMES STERNGOLD"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd19c428eb7c8105d6ad8a4","word_count":980},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1991\/11\/24\/books\/new-noteworthy.html","snippet":"NORTH OF HOPE, by Jon Hassler.
