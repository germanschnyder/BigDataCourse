He and his military colleagues, he complained, were being accused abroad of being torturers and assassins, and accused at home of being bunglers. People had forgotten, he said. They had forgotten that the nation was in peril in March 1976 when the armed forces overthrew President Isabel Martinez de Peron. Political terrorists were running amok, and the economy was in havoc. ''We did what we had to do,'' he said. The costs were high. Many thousands on both sides were killed, including more than 6,000 who were reportedly ''disappeared'' into the hands of state security forces. ''But every war,'' he said, ''has its casualties and missing.''","abstract":null,"print_page":"12","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"ARGENTINA AFTER THE FALKLANDS"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"ARGENTINA"},{"name":"subject","value":"SOCIAL CONDITIONS AND TRENDS"},{"name":"subject","value":"ARMAMENT, DEFENSE AND MILITARY FORCES"},{"name":"subject","value":"POLITICS AND GOVERNMENT"},{"name":"subject","value":"ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND TRENDS"},{"name":"subject","value":"FREEDOM AND HUMAN RIGHTS"}],"pub_date":"1982-12-26T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Magazine Desk","section_name":"Magazine","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Edward","rank":1,"lastname":"Schumacher"}],"original":"By Edward Schumacher; Edward Schumacher is chief of The New York Time's bureau in Buenos Aires"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd12a878eb7c8105d5f2adb","word_count":4575},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1982\/12\/27\/nyregion\/sindona-in-us-prison-stays-enmeshed-in-global-inquiries.html","snippet":"Two years after he began serving a Federal prison term for bank fraud, Michele Sindona is enmeshed in international investigations involving multimillion-dollar financial swindles, a mysterious right-wing political organization, murder and the...","lead_paragraph":"Two years after he began serving a Federal prison term for bank fraud, Michele Sindona is enmeshed in international investigations involving multimillion-dollar financial swindles, a mysterious right-wing political organization, murder and the underworld. Mr. Sindona once headed a $500 million financial empire. He was a financial adviser to the Vatican and sped to the world's financial capitals in a private jet. Now, at a Federal prison in Otisville, N.Y., he is a gaunt, grayhaired figure, clothed in a drab blue-denim uniform and sneakers.
