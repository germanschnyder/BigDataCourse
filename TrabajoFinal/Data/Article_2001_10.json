Without hesitation, Ms. Allende said she thought of Chile, her native land, and what happened there on Sept. 11, 1973. That was the day the military toppled the democratically elected government of Salvador Allende, causing his death. Ms. Allende, a second cousin of Mr. Allende, fled soon after. That two barbaric events in the Americas happened on the same date is an eerie coincidence that startles Ms. Allende and other Latinos now living in the United States. But what resonates with many is not so much that violence has chased them to a new, democratic country. Instead, they are dreading what could come after -- and in their homelands often did.","abstract":"Latinos now living in United States react to Sept 11 terrorist attack with apprehension; many of them fled countries where ardent nationalism was often step toward increasingly authoritarian government, and where military ruled at will; what resonates is not so much that violence has chased them to new, democratic country; instead, they dread what could come after--and in their homelands often did; they remain critical of any abuse of power or attempt at censorship from those who think united, unquestioning country makes nation stronger; photo (M)","print_page":"5","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"The Nation; Through a Prism of a Latin Past"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"NEW YORK CITY"},{"name":"glocations","value":"LATIN AMERICA"},{"name":"glocations","value":"WASHINGTON (DC)"},{"name":"subject","value":"WORLD TRADE CENTER (NYC)"},{"name":"subject","value":"AIRLINES AND AIRPLANES"},{"name":"subject","value":"IMMIGRATION AND REFUGEES"},{"name":"subject","value":"HIJACKING"},{"name":"subject","value":"SECURITY AND WARNING SYSTEMS"},{"name":"subject","value":"TERRORISM"}],"pub_date":"2001-12-09T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Week in Review Desk","section_name":"Week in Review","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Mirta","rank":1,"lastname":"OJITO"}],"original":"By MIRTA OJITO"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd2292e8eb7c8105d7b2dbc","word_count":1095},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2001\/12\/17\/business\/international-business-globalization-marches-on-as-us-eases-up-on-the-reins.html","snippet":"To hear Eastman Kodak tell it -- and many other multinationals -- globalization marches inexorably forward.

Neither incessant protests, nor worldwide recession nor the war on terrorism stops it. Kodak's overseas sales, after all, generate more than half its annual revenue, and the percentage is rising. The company has factories in Britain, France, Brazil, Mexico, Canada, India, China and Japan. Cameras and film flow constantly across borders, at a cost of $200 million a year in tariffs. And now, despite the anger and turmoil surrounding the issue, the nations of the world have agreed to negotiate yet another round of tariff-cutting.","abstract":"Bush administration succeeded in Doha, Qatar, in getting members of World Trade Organization to agree to another round of negotiations to lower barriers to trade, but doing so required certain compromises, like watering down of protections for brand-name drugs; globalization is gradually slipping from control of US and other industrial nations as developing countries gain ground in a few battles; photo (M)","print_page":"12","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"International Business; Globalization Marches On, as U.S. Eases Up on the Reins"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"BUSH, GEORGE W"},{"name":"organizations","value":"WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION"},{"name":"subject","value":"INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND WORLD MARKET"},{"name":"subject","value":"CUSTOMS (TARIFF)"},{"name":"subject","value":"ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND TRENDS"},{"name":"subject","value":"THIRD WORLD AND DEVELOPING COUNTRIES"}],"pub_date":"2001-12-17T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Business\/Financial Desk","section_name":"Business","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Louis","rank":1,"lastname":"UCHITELLE"}],"original":"By LOUIS UCHITELLE"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd219628eb7c8105d79751f","word_count":1702},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2001\/12\/20\/world\/reeling-from-riots-argentina-declares-a-state-of-siege.html","snippet":"President Fernando de la R\u00faa declared a 30-day state of siege after food riots and looting broke out across Argentina today, and the police fired rubber bullets and tear gas at rock-throwing protesters in Buenos Aires and several provincial cities....","lead_paragraph":"President Fernando de la R\u00faa declared a 30-day state of siege after food riots and looting broke out across Argentina today, and the police fired rubber bullets and tear gas at rock-throwing protesters in Buenos Aires and several provincial cities. Five people were killed in the rioting. The most widespread social disturbances since the 1980's came on a sweltering summer day.
