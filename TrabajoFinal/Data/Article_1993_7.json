Last week the International Monetary Fund handed Russia $1.5 billion. The World Bank has approved a mammoth $660 million loan to develop Russia's oil industry, and dispersed hundreds of millions to pay for medicine and other needed imports. President Clinton deserves credit for persuading his allies to aid Russia. He pressured the I.M.F. to provide money before Russia could complete key reforms; he orchestrated the West's offer of a $28 billion package in April and pushed a $2.5 billion bilateral aid bill through the House.","abstract":null,"print_page":"20","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Keep the Aid Flowing to Russia"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"YELTSIN, BORIS N"},{"name":"glocations","value":"RUSSIA"},{"name":"subject","value":"EDITORIALS"},{"name":"subject","value":"ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND TRENDS"},{"name":"subject","value":"FOREIGN AID"}],"pub_date":"1993-07-05T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Editorial Desk","section_name":"Opinion","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"Editorial","_id":"4fd1a99f8eb7c8105d6c6881","word_count":565},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1993\/07\/07\/world\/accord-is-reached-at-trade-parley.html","snippet":"Trade ministers for the leading industrial nations said today that they have reached a crucial tariff reduction agreement that they said will likely lead to a revival of stalled global trade talks.   \"We have concluded our deliberations...","lead_paragraph":"Trade ministers for the leading industrial nations said today that they have reached a crucial tariff reduction agreement that they said will likely lead to a revival of stalled global trade talks. \"We have concluded our deliberations successfully,\" Kabun Muto, Japan's Foreign Minister, said upon emerging from a meeting of trade officials of the United States, Canada, Japan and the European Community. \"We believe it will result in substantial progress.\"","abstract":null,"print_page":"9","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"ACCORD IS REACHED AT TRADE PARLEY"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"TOKYO (JAPAN)"},{"name":"organizations","value":"GROUP OF SEVEN"},{"name":"subject","value":"INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND WORLD MARKET"},{"name":"subject","value":"CUSTOMS (TARIFF)"},{"name":"subject","value":"SUMMIT CONFERENCES"}],"pub_date":"1993-07-07T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Foreign Desk","section_name":"World","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd1e0538eb7c8105d72701e","word_count":809},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1993\/07\/08\/world\/summit-in-tokyo-many-loose-ends-must-be-tied-up.html","snippet":"An agreement to cut tariffs that was heralded here today as a significant achievement still leaves several contentious issues to be resolved before the completion of an accord to lower worldwide barriers to trade.

Rockefeller Center, after all, isn't leaving New York. But why must we travel to Japan to see major public buildings as fine as the one Mr. Vinoly has designed for Tokyo? This prodigiously gifted architect lives right here. At least we get to see the models. Mr. Vinoly's plans for the Tokyo International Forum are on view now in the architecture and design galleries at the Museum of Modern Art, as part of the museum's continuing series of shows devoted to important public works. This is the first show in the series to feature a single project by one firm, and the honor is richly deserved. The $1 billion project, which will be completed in 1996, is one of the largest under construction in the world today. It is also among the most sublime. Mr. Vinoly's design goes far toward dispelling disillusionment with the bloated scale of recent civic projects. And it revives faith in architecture as an instrument of intellectual clarity.","abstract":null,"print_page":"30","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Review\/Architecture; Vinoly's Vision for Tokyo, and for the Identity of Japan"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"VINOLY, RAFAEL"},{"name":"glocations","value":"TOKYO (JAPAN)"},{"name":"organizations","value":"MUSEUM OF MODERN ART"},{"name":"organizations","value":"TOKYO INTERNATIONAL FORUM"},{"name":"subject","value":"ARCHITECTURE"}],"pub_date":"1993-07-16T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Weekend Desk","section_name":"Arts","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Herbert","rank":1,"lastname":"MUSCHAMP"}],"original":"By HERBERT MUSCHAMP"},"type_of_material":"Biography; Review","_id":"4fd1bd038eb7c8105d6e9410","word_count":1242},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1993\/07\/20\/world\/spy-network-inflaming-uruguay-chile-tension.html","snippet":"On a lazy morning last November in this beach town 30 miles outside the capital, Montevideo, a man staying in a white bungalow broke a window from the inside, climbed out and rushed to a neighbor's house pleading for help.

But by the end of the day, an entry in the police record indicated, Eugenio Berrios had recanted his accusations, saying he had been under too much emotional stress.
