Assembling that show had a profound influence on him, he recalled: ''I did three years of field work. After traveling to 17 Latin American countries, I began to see some blatant similarities in the objects, artistically speaking.'' In 1988, for example, he visited rural Tabasco, Mexico, where in a church he discovered a series of wooden model ships, some from as early as the 18th century, hanging from the ceiling of the nave. ''These delightful carvings,'' he later wrote, ''were votive offerings left by sailors and fishermen in appreciation for safe delivery from storms.'' On trips to Colombia, Peru, Venezuela and Oaxaca, Mexico, Dr. Oettinger found similar ex votos (votive offerings) -- ''charming testaments to the power of the saints to save endangered sailors.'' He assumed that these boats were an art form native only to Latin America.","abstract":"Antiques column on exhibit of folk art of Spain and the Americas, now at San Antonio Museum of Art; curator Dr Marion Oettinger Jr comments; show's other stops in US noted (S)","print_page":"37","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Antiques; Folk Art: The Spanish Connection"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"OETTINGER, MARION JR"},{"name":"organizations","value":"SAN ANTONIO MUSEUM OF ART"},{"name":"subject","value":"ANTIQUES"},{"name":"subject","value":"ART"}],"pub_date":"1997-10-31T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Leisure\/Weekend Desk","section_name":"Arts","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Wendy","rank":1,"lastname":"Moonan"}],"original":"By Wendy Moonan"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd1d5338eb7c8105d712b99","word_count":1142},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1997\/11\/16\/books\/books-in-brief-fiction-017752.html","snippet":"The Tree of Red Stars   By Tessa Bridal.
