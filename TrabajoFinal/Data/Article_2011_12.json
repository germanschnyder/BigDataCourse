It had been a long, involved trip: he came from Brussels to Genoa by train, secretly chartered a ship to avoid public notice and, on the night of Sept. 7, sailed through the Ligurian Sea to Sardinia. Landing late the next day, he hired a small boat to take him to Caprera, then walked more than a mile on a narrow path across the rocky, windswept island.","abstract":"How close did the Italian hero come to leading the Union army?

It's more sculpture than cabin, constructed from panes of glass, wood, plastic, bamboo blinds and green plexiglass, with tall, lush plants growing out of the floor. On a recent visit to the village, I knocked on its door to find Omar Santiago, a scruffy Uruguayan in his late 20s, arranging to rent the house to a Chilean couple. ''I'm not a hippie,'' he said, pointing to his ringing phone. ''Look here, a business call.'' When his place is rented, Santiago later explained, he sleeps in a tent he keeps pitched on the beach. I asked him if he owned his plot, and a playful smile crept across his face. ''Yes and no,'' he said.","abstract":null,"print_page":"95","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"The Coast of Utopia"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"2011-10-02T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"T: Design Magazine","section_name":"Arts; Style; Magazine","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Maxine","lastname":"SWANN"}],"original":"By MAXINE SWANN"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd2b9598eb7c8105d8af676","word_count":1506}]},"status":"OK","copyright":"Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
