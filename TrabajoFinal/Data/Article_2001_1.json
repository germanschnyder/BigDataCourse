The tiny virus, which is now forcing the slaughter and incineration of tens of thousands of farm animals in Britain and several countries on the Continent, is in the same family as those causing the common cold. It can be spread by direct or indirect contact with infected animals; by people exposed to the virus who develop no symptoms but who harbor and spread it; by contaminated shoes, clothing, vehicles, farm implements, meat, milk and garbage, and by air. Weather permitting, the virus can travel many miles.","abstract":"Some experts warn return of foot-and-mouth disease to United States, which experienced last outbreak in 1929, is inevitable; disease is endemic in number of areas, where periodic outbreaks sometimes have severe economic consequences; vaccination of farm animals has not proved effective because it makes it impossible to tell which animals are infected and which protected (M)","print_page":"6","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"U.S. Free of Disease for 70 Years, but Some Call Its Return Inevitable"},"keywords":[{"name":"subject","value":"LIVESTOCK"},{"name":"subject","value":"VACCINATION AND IMMUNIZATION"},{"name":"subject","value":"FOOT-AND-MOUTH DISEASE"}],"pub_date":"2001-03-03T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Foreign Desk","section_name":"World; Health","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"firstname":"Jane","middlename":"E.","lastname":"BRODY","rank":1,"role":"reported","organization":""}],"original":"By JANE E.

I've been battered by seasonal allergies all my life but relied on family doctors and, more recently, ''primary-care physicians'' for relief. In a kind of a pharmaceutical version of playing catch with Dad, my father and I shared his hay-fever pills when I was growing up. They were smooth, round yellow tablets, etched with a tiny red corporate symbol that was as delicate as a Chinese ideograph. At a time before people routinely gobbled down a half dozen medicines a day, those pills held a kind of mythic power for me, not only because they could make the misery of allergies disappear but also because they were prescription drugs -- inherently more powerful, more inaccessible, more special. Those yellow pills were called Chlor-Trimeton, manufactured by the Schering-Plough Corporation, first as a prescription drug and then, after 1976, as an over-the-counter medication. It definitely worked, but it knocked me out. I remember days when I felt glazed by sleepiness. Even as the high tide in my nose and throat subsided, I felt mentally waterlogged.","abstract":"Stephen S Hall article details history of Schering-Plough's prescription allergy drug Claritin, holding it reveals why Americans pay premium prices for new drugs that may not be better than older ones; notes aggressively marketed drug is most frequently dispensed drug sample in United States, part of nearly $8 billion worth of free samples that drug companies give to doctors annually; notes drug, designed to relieve symptoms, not offer cure, is only moderately effective at doing so; notes it is sold over-the-counter in many nations at much lower cost; photo (L)","print_page":"40","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"The Claritin Effect; Prescription for Profit"},"keywords":[{"name":"organizations","value":"SCHERING-PLOUGH CORP"},{"name":"subject","value":"ANTIHISTAMINES"},{"name":"subject","value":"MARKETING AND MERCHANDISING"},{"name":"subject","value":"CLARITIN (DRUG)"},{"name":"subject","value":"DRUGS (PHARMACEUTICALS)"},{"name":"subject","value":"PRICES (FARES, FEES AND RATES)"},{"name":"subject","value":"ALLERGIES"}],"pub_date":"2001-03-11T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Magazine Desk","section_name":"Health; Magazine","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"firstname":"Stephen","middlename":"S.","lastname":"Hall","rank":1,"role":"reported","organization":""}],"original":"By Stephen S.
