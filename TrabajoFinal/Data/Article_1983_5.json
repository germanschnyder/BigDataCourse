The inquiry is expected to be part of a research project examining the disabilities of professional musicians. Questionnaires have been distributed to members of the Boston Symphony Orchestra; the doctors also plan to distribute the forms to students at the New England Conservatory, the Curtis Institute of Music and the Peabody Conservatory. The two physicians, Dr. Fred H. Hochberg, a neurologist, and Dr. Robert D. Leffert, an orthopedic surgeon, are part of a team of doctors treating medical problems of musicians at the hospital. About 250 patients have been seen since Gary Graffman went for treatment in 1980 after suffering from difficulties using his right hand. Mr. Graffman referred Mr. Fleisher to the doctors. Mr. Fleisher had to retire from his career as a pianist in the early 1960's because of debilitating cramps and tension in his right hand.","abstract":null,"print_page":"23","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"WHY DOES IT HURT?","kicker":"MUSIC NOTES"},"keywords":[{"name":"subject","value":"MUSIC"},{"name":"subject","value":"MEDICINE AND HEALTH"}],"pub_date":"1983-06-12T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Arts and Leisure Desk","section_name":"Arts; Health","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Edward","rank":1,"lastname":"ROTHSTEIN"}],"original":"By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd12f198eb7c8105d5fb6f2","word_count":1031},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1983\/06\/17\/business\/brazilian-loan-needs.html","snippet":"Carlos Langoni, president of Brazil's central bank, said yesterday that Brazil would need more bank loans than the $4.4 billion already promised for this year, and that short-term financing needs for 1984 are now under discussion.

The $2 billion gap primarily grows out of the failure of Saudi Arabia to make a promised loan to the Fund that officials there had expected.

One opportunity to do that arises in pretrial depositions, when the defendants have a broad license to inquire into the plaintiff's activities, finances and personal life. Depositions are generally a matter of public record, meaning that the news organization can publish material from them and possibly embarrass the subject further. In several recent cases, the plaintiffs have countered that implicit threat, persuading judges to seal the records. Two such cases advanced in the courts recently, with differing results.","abstract":null,"print_page":"4","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"SEALING OF PRETRIAL RECORD IS AT ISSUE IN 2 LIBEL CASES","kicker":"PRESS NOTES"},"keywords":[{"name":"subject","value":"NEWSPAPERS"},{"name":"subject","value":"SUITS AND LITIGATION"},{"name":"subject","value":"LIBEL AND SLANDER"},{"name":"subject","value":"DECISIONS AND VERDICTS"},{"name":"subject","value":"NEWS AND NEWS MEDIA"}],"pub_date":"1983-07-01T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"National Desk","section_name":"U.S.","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Jonathan","rank":1,"lastname":"FRIENDLY"}],"original":"By JONATHAN FRIENDLY"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd146288eb7c8105d620ff0","word_count":740},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1983\/07\/03\/world\/music-sparks-political-protest-of-chile-youth.html","snippet":"A popular Chilean folk singer was ostensibly singing a love ballad, but it was the forbidden political meaning and President Augusto Pinochet's Chile that excited the young people crammed into the smoky cafe.

''Come and participate,'' the singer, Payo Grondona, gently sang. ''Mobilize all your ardor without repression.'' As he began the next line, ''Tenderness united will never be conquered,'' the audience erupted into a roar accompanied by clapping. The line was a play on the Chilean protest call, ''A people united will never be conquered,'' and they sang it over and over. It was an example of the growing popularity of what is called ''canto nuevo,'' or ''new song,'' a music of protest and a search for roots that reflects a political reawakening among Chilean young people.","abstract":null,"print_page":"1","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"MUSIC SPARKS POLITICAL PROTEST OF CHILE YOUTH"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"CHILE"},{"name":"subject","value":"SOCIAL CONDITIONS AND TRENDS"},{"name":"subject","value":"CHILDREN AND YOUTH"},{"name":"subject","value":"POLITICS AND GOVERNMENT"},{"name":"subject","value":"DEMONSTRATIONS AND RIOTS"}],"pub_date":"1983-07-03T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Foreign Desk","section_name":"World","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Edward","rank":1,"lastname":"SCHUMACHER"},{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":2}],"original":"By EDWARD SCHUMACHER, Special to the New York Times"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd134078eb7c8105d603cf0","word_count":1248},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1983\/07\/03\/travel\/what-s-doing-in-switzerland-s-valais.html","snippet":"PAUL HOFMANN, formerly a correspondent for The New York Times, lives in Rome.

One of the more unusual attractions of the Swiss canton of Valais is a 600-year-old organ, believed to be the oldest functioning organ in the world. It is housed in an 800-year-old fortress-church on a hill in Sion, the capital of the canton, and at 4 o'clock every Saturday afternoon from July 10 to Sept. 11 hymns, psalms and diverse sacred melodies by Orlando di Lasso, Tomas Luis de Victoria, Giovanni Gabrieli, Claudio Monteverdi, Dietrich Buxtehude, Giovanni Pergolesi and other pre-Baroque and Baroque composers will be performed there during the International Festival of Ancient Organ Music by organists from Uruguay, the Netherlands, East and West Germany and Switzerland. The organ, built in 1390 and most recently restored in 1954, is mounted on a wooden pulpit jutting out like a ship's bow from the rear wall of the Romanesque-Gothic church, once the Cathedral of Sion and one of Switzerland's most haunting edifices. Admission to the concerts is $2.50, students and children half price. A record of music that has been played on the historic instrument - representing composers ranging from Gabrieli to Haydn - is available for $12.50.","abstract":null,"print_page":"10","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"WHAT'S DOING IN SWITZERLAND'S VALAIS"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"SWITZERLAND"},{"name":"subject","value":"GEOGRAPHIC PROFILES"},{"name":"subject","value":"TRAVEL AND VACATIONS"}],"pub_date":"1983-07-03T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Travel Desk","section_name":"Travel","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Paul","rank":1,"lastname":"HOFMANN"}],"original":"By PAUL HOFMANN"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd12e6c8eb7c8105d5f9faa","word_count":1878},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1983\/07\/16\/sports\/title-bout-is-called-off-challenger-overweight.html","snippet":"Eddie Mustafa Muhammad, 2 1\/2 pounds over the light-heavyweight limit of 175 at the official weigh-in this morning, played the heavy in a figurative sense as well today.

To cap the day, a skirmish involving two former world champions, a promoter and his father disrupted an evening news conference held to explain the cancellation.
