Uruguay has won the tournament twice - in 1930 and 1950 - but has not reached this stage in 40 years. The Netherlands, famed for decades for elegant play, reached consecutive finals in 1974 and 1978 but has never won the Cup. Diego Forlan and Luis Suarez have led Uruguay with three goals each, but Suarez is unavailable for this match; his intentional goal-line handball - cynical or brilliant, depending on your view - saved his team in the dying seconds of regulation time against Ghana but earned him a red card and a one-game suspension. The gritty play of Mark van Bommel in the Netherlands' midfield gives Robin van Persie, Arjen Robben and Wesley Sneijder the freedom to attack. Sneijder, an eagle-eyed playmaker, has scored four goals. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.","abstract":null,"print_page":"10","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Uruguay vs. Netherlands","kicker":"GOAL"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"2010-07-06T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Sports Desk","section_name":"Sports","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Andrew","lastname":"KEH"}],"original":"By ANDREW KEH"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd2a7f28eb7c8105d891a2b","word_count":168},{"web_url":"http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/fullpage.html?res=940DE2DD1531F935A35754C0A9669D8B63","snippet":"In sports it can be good to be selfish.

For those who do not know, Cruyff is considered the best player the Netherlands has ever had. Internationally he ranks among the greats, just slightly behind Maradona and Pele. The story goes that when Cruyff received the ball with two men on him the youth coach would tell him to pass off to other players. Cruyff had his own ideas about the game so often he would take on and beat the first, then the second and maybe a third defender, with the coach yelling at him the entire time to pass the ball.","abstract":"Goal column analyzes the strengths and weaknesses of the Dutch style of playing soccer as Netherlands prepares to face Uruguay in the World Cup semifinals; other World Cup news noted (M)","print_page":"11","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Dutch Need Greed, But Also Balance","kicker":"GOAL"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"NETHERLANDS"},{"name":"glocations","value":"URUGUAY"},{"name":"subject","value":"WORLD CUP (SOCCER)"},{"name":"subject","value":"SOCCER"}],"pub_date":"2010-07-06T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Sports Desk","section_name":"Sports","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"John","lastname":"O'BRIEN"}],"original":"By JOHN O'BRIEN"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd2b6c58eb7c8105d8ab46f","word_count":918},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/slideshow\/2010\/07\/06\/sports\/soccer\/20100622WORLDCUP.html","snippet":"Images from the World Cup semifinal between the Netherlands and Uruguay from Cape Town, South Africa.","lead_paragraph":"Images from the World Cup semifinal between the Netherlands and Uruguay from Cape Town, South Africa.","abstract":null,"print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":null,"multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Photo Replay: July 6"},"keywords":[{"name":"subject","value":"WORLD CUP (SOCCER)"},{"name":"subject","value":"WORLD CUP 2010 (SOCCER)"},{"name":"subject","value":"SOCCER"},{"name":"organizations","value":""},{"name":"glocations","value":"NETHERLANDS"},{"name":"glocations","value":"URUGUAY"},{"name":"persons","value":""},{"name":"creative_works","value":""}],"pub_date":"2010-07-06T00:00:00Z","document_type":"multimedia","news_desk":null,"section_name":null,"subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":null,"_id":"504a8c061c22dfde670c40e5","word_count":25},{"web_url":"http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/fullpage.html?res=9E07E3DA1131F935A35754C0A9669D8B63","snippet":"DURBAN, South Africa -- The referees for the semifinals were announced today, and the full list of candidates to officiate the final four games was posted.
