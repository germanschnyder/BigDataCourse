Franklin put it last week. But now the exports are shrinking, and that fact may endanger the economic recovery. In January, the Commerce Department reported last week, exports fell for the third straight month, largely because of a fall in shipments of capital equipment used by businesses abroad. The problem does not seem to be American competitiveness, although the stronger dollar is not helping. Foreign economies simply are buying less as they experience their own weakness.","abstract":null,"print_page":"1","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"A Weak Europe Could Prevent U.S. Recovery","kicker":"MARKET WATCH"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"UNITED STATES"},{"name":"organizations","value":"COMMERCE DEPARTMENT"},{"name":"subject","value":"INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND WORLD MARKET"},{"name":"subject","value":"UNITED STATES ECONOMY"}],"pub_date":"1992-03-22T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Financial Desk","section_name":"Business","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Floyd","rank":1,"lastname":"Norris"}],"original":"By Floyd Norris"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd1b3608eb7c8105d6d6cfc","word_count":485},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1992\/03\/22\/nyregion\/volunteers-offer-worldwide-advice.html","snippet":"THREE days a week, Charlie Bevis of Westport drives 30 miles round trip to the world headquarters of the International Executive Service Corps in Stamford, where he puts in a full day of work on various global communications projects.
