Their gaunt bodies, sunken cheeks and near-shaven heads immediately identified them. Only that morning, one of them, Raul Rodriguez, a 41-year-old former journalist, had been ordered, ''Get your things ready, you're off.'' He was told to sign a document testifying that he had been well treated during his 10 years in jail, but he refused. A few hours later, he and several other former Tupamaro guerrillas were freed anyway.","abstract":null,"print_page":"2","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"FOR FREED LEFTISTS IN URUGUAY, HIDDEN TERRORS"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"URUGUAY"},{"name":"subject","value":"ARMAMENT, DEFENSE AND MILITARY FORCES"},{"name":"subject","value":"POLITICAL PRISONERS"},{"name":"subject","value":"POLITICS AND GOVERNMENT (1983)"},{"name":"subject","value":"CIVIL WAR AND GUERRILLA WARFARE"},{"name":"subject","value":"REFUGEES AND EXPATRIATES"},{"name":"subject","value":"AMNESTIES"}],"pub_date":"1985-03-07T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Foreign Desk","section_name":"World","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Alan","rank":1,"lastname":"RIDING"}],"original":"By ALAN RIDING"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd1592f8eb7c8105d63d83f","word_count":1174},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1985\/03\/10\/weekinreview\/past-weighs-heavy-on-latin-democracies.html","snippet":"When Brazil's new civilian President takes over on Friday after 21 years of military Government, 90 percent of Latin America's inhabitants will be living under civilian rule, a situation unmatched since 1961.

But President Tancredo Neves, who will receive the legacy of Brazil's vast resources, will also inherit the consequences of longstanding neglect of the country's basic needs. A succession of countries - Brazil will be the ninth - have moved from military to civilian governments since 1979, but almost without exception they have continued to live with acute economic and foreign debt crises, inflexible as well as unjust social structures and the perennial shadow of interference by the military.
