Top-seeded Stefan Edberg, fresh from Sunday's tournament victory in Madrid, also breezed into the third round by eliminating Marcelino Filippini of Uruguay, 6-3, 6-3. Ivan Lendl, seeded No. 3, also reached the third round by edging Alberto Mancini of Argentina, 6-2, 0-6, 6-2. The Olympic champion, Marc Rosset of Switzerland, was forced to withdraw from his second-round match against Francisco Clavet of Spain because of tonsillitis. (AP) A Day for Teen-Agers: Jennifer Capriati overcame an aching elbow and more than 20 unforced errors and beat Sandra Cecchini, Italy's top female player, 6-3, 6-2, in the Italian Open in Rome. But the 17-year-old American had to take runner-up honors for the day's thrills to Francesca Bentivoglio, a 16-year-old qualifier from Italy. Cheered on by a large center court crowd at the Foro Italico, Bentivoglio upset seventh-seeded Jana Novotna, 7-5, 7-6 (7-5). The victory by the youngster, ranked 329th in the world, kept alive Italy's slim hopes in the clay-court classic, which has not been won by an Italian since Raffaela Reggi in 1985.

This was the first time the two played since their stirring opening-round match at the 1991 United States Open. At that time, Connors rebounded from a two-set, 0-3 deficit to win in five sets and make a theatrical march to the semifinals. But the 40-year-old Connors is now concentrating on business ventures and the start of his 35-and-older tour. He has played in only five tournaments this year, losing in the first round four times, and is ranked 172d in the world. Last night, he was betrayed by an erratic serve. In the 11th game of the first set, he served three of his six double faults, virtually handing the set to the McEnroe, who is ranked 88th.
