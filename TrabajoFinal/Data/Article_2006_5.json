Some would say that order has been restored to soccer's universe as six teams from Europe and two from South America will play for a spot in the final in Berlin on July 9. Only four years ago the quarterfinals were a revelation, but five of those teams are missing: the United States, South Korea and Spain; Senegal and Turkey did not qualify for the 2006 World Cup. By JACK BELL QUARTERFINAL MATCHUPS GERMANY-ARGENTINA Both countries have won the tournament as hosts: Germany in 1974, Argentina in 1978. And this game has the feel of a final - Argentina beat West Germany for the title in Mexico in 1986, and West Germany turned the tables in Italy in 1990. The Germans have looked unbeatable at home; Argentina has simply looked unbeatable. After yielding two goals in the opener, Germany's much-maligned defense has had shutouts the past three games while Miroslav Klose has scored four goals in the tournament. The Argentines have a deep roster that mixes experience and youth. Lionel Messi and Carlos Tevez, starters on nearly any team in the world, are reserves for Argentina. EDGE: Argentina ITALY-UKRAINE Playing in its first World Cup as an independent nation, Ukraine has given its 23 players a shared $8 million bonus for making the quarterfinals. Ukraine is the only team to lose its first game of the tournament and still be playing. It should surprise no one that Italy, with a savvy stalwart defense and goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon, has yielded only one goal in four games. It often seems the Italians find an operatic way to tease and then vanquish the opposition. EDGE: Italy ENGLAND-PORTUGAL England's Wayne Rooney said he was ready to play 90 minutes, or more, after bouncing back from a broken foot. David Beckham's lethal free kicks have obscured an offense that is struggling. England has only won the Cup as host in 1966, and it has been 40 years in the wilderness since. Portugal has received a boost from the veteran Lu\u00eds Figo, but it will be without the suspended Deco and Costinha. EDGE: Portugal BRAZIL-FRANCE The old men of Europe (France) against the defending champion (Brazil). A rematch of the 1998 final, won by host France, 3-0. That was eight years ago, and while the French team includes the veteran holdovers Zin\u00e9dine Zidane, Patrick Vieira, Lilian Thuram and Fabien Barthiez, the young Brazilian stallions Ronaldinho, Adriano and Kak\u00e1 will be hard to stop.
