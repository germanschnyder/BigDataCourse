So daunting were the arrangements needed, Mr. Lupinacci recalled in an interview, that his seven mission staff members abandoned protocol and diplomatic hierarchy to prepare for the first visit ever of a Uruguayan president to the United Nations. While tending to such diplomatic duties as arranging Mr. Sanguinetti's overloaded schedule, Mr. Lupinacci also bought armchairs for the meeting room in the mission where the President would receive his guests. He sent his chauffeur, who was doubling as a typist, to the United Nations souvenir shop to buy tiny flag centerpieces representing the countries whose foreign ministers and heads of state Mr. Sanguinetti would be meeting. One of Mr. Lupinacci's junior diplomats canvassed limousine-rental companies to find the best price.","abstract":null,"print_page":"16","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"URUGUAYANS PLAY HOST, FRANTICALLY"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"SANGUINETTI, JULIO MARIA"},{"name":"persons","value":"LUPINACCI, JULIO CESAR"},{"name":"glocations","value":"URUGUAY"},{"name":"organizations","value":"UNITED NATIONS"},{"name":"organizations","value":"GENERAL ASSEMBLY"},{"name":"subject","value":"INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS"}],"pub_date":"1985-09-26T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Foreign Desk","section_name":"World","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Elaine","rank":1,"lastname":"SCIOLINO"},{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":2}],"original":"By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to the New York Times"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd1633d8eb7c8105d64ec68","word_count":897},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1985\/09\/29\/sports\/le-bon-yacht-in-whitbread.html","snippet":"In yacht racing, there are few challenges more arduous than the Whitbread Around the World Race.

Yet 15 sailboats with international crews appeared ready for the task yesterday as the 1985-86 Whitbread fleet sailed from Portsmouth, England, for the beginning of a 27,000-mile global voyage. Among them was Drum England, the 77-foot sloop owned by the British pop star Simon Le Bon of the rock group Duran Duran. It was the same boat that capsized off Britain Aug. 12 when the 14-foot keel of the newly built ocean racer dropped off in the middle of the Fastnet Race. The 24-man crew was rescued, including Le Bon, who had been one of six crew members trapped inside the overturned hull.

The design was unveiled Feb. 16 in Richmond, Va. At that time the stamp was expected to be released in July, but the heavy schedule of new issues this year resulted in its postponement. The George Washington portrait depicted is primarily based on a Gilbert Stuart painting. Since the Washington Monument was dedicated 100 years ago, its inclusion on this stamp is an appropriate gesture.
