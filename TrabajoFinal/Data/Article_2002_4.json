Players are dropping out at a regular rate with injuries, tired and vulnerable after long seasons in their professional leagues. The United States is not immune. It lost its defensive midfielder, Chris Armas, to a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee on Sunday. That is why Coach Bruce Arena may want to consider swaddling Brian McBride in Bubble Wrap. McBride, 29, scored the only goal for the United States in the 1998 World Cup. A 6-foot-1-inch forward, he excels in the air and is reliable with his back to the goal. Yet soccer forwards, like boxers, lead with their faces. It is an occupational hazard. There is no padded protection against the lance of an elbow or the slam of a head. Since the last World Cup, McBride has twice had shattered cheekbones reconstructed and has undergone two operations for a rare clotting disorder in his right arm.","abstract":"Columbus Crew soccer player Brian McBride is expected to join US national World Cup team after three seasons of injuries and health problems; photo (M)","print_page":"8","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Now the Easy Part: McBride Is Healthy","kicker":"SOCCER"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"MCBRIDE, BRIAN"},{"name":"organizations","value":"COLUMBUS CREW"},{"name":"subject","value":"WORLD CUP (SOCCER)"},{"name":"subject","value":"SOCCER"}],"pub_date":"2002-05-16T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Sports Desk","section_name":"Sports","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Jere","rank":1,"lastname":"LONGMAN"}],"original":"By JERE LONGMAN"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd22f6e8eb7c8105d7bdae0","word_count":941},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2002\/05\/17\/sports\/soccer-young-us-players-excel-but-the-news-isn-t-all-good.html","snippet":"The United States soccer team again received encouraging performances from its younger players in overwhelming Jamaica, 5-0, tonight.
