Such is the case with Luis Camnitzer, who, in his early 70s and with a half-century career behind him, is just now having his first New York museum survey. The show, at El Museo del Barrio, is terse, almost to the vanishing point in places, as might be expected from one of the pioneers of 1960s Conceptualism.

When she was a high-school student in Manhattan in the mid-1980s, she walked home at night from her job at Pasta & Cheese, on the Upper East Side, to the apartment where she grew up, on East 25th Street. When she began her prison sentence in Peru, in 1996, for collaborating with a terrorist group, convicted terrorists had to spend 231\/2 hours a day inside their cells. Even then, Berenson walked in the 6-by-9-foot space she and another woman shared -- two steps forward, two steps backward -- for hours. ''People ask, what did you miss most?'' she said in August, two and a half months after she was released on parole, having served nearly 15 years of a 20-year sentence. ''This was definitely it.'' It was after dark, and we were taking a rapid, circuitous walk through a park that clutches the crumbly cliff tops in the Miraflores district of Lima, where Berenson and her 15-month-old son, Salvador, had been living since her release. (Berenson's parole requires that she remain in Peru until 2015.) They were sharing an apartment with a family friend and, temporarily, Berenson's parents, who were visiting from New York. Berenson had recently separated from her husband -- Salvador's father -- whom she'd met in prison while he, too, was serving a sentence for terrorism. Soon after his release in 2003, they married, and Salvador was conceived during a conjugal visit. The boy spent his first year of life with Berenson in the women's prison in Chorrillos, Lima.","abstract":"Jennifer Egan article profiles Lori Berenson, American woman who was convicted of collaborating with the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement in Peru in 1996 and who has been released on parole; photos (L)","print_page":"30","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"url":"images\/2011\/03\/06\/magazine\/06berenson-cover\/06berenson-cover-thumbStandard.jpg","subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"hasthumbnail":"Y","thumbnailheight":75,"thumbnail":"images\/2011\/03\/06\/magazine\/06berenson-cover\/06berenson-cover-thumbStandard.jpg"},"type":"image","height":75},{"subtype":"xlarge","url":"images\/2011\/03\/06\/magazine\/06berenson-cover\/06berenson-cover-articleLarge.jpg","height":397,"width":600,"legacy":{"xlargewidth":600,"hasxlarge":"Y","xlarge":"images\/2011\/03\/06\/magazine\/06berenson-cover\/06berenson-cover-articleLarge.jpg","xlargeheight":397},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"main":"THE LIBERATION OF LORI BERENSON"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"BERENSON, LORI HELENE"},{"name":"persons","value":"BERENSON, LORI"},{"name":"glocations","value":"PERU"},{"name":"organizations","value":"SHINING PATH"},{"name":"organizations","value":"TUPAC AMARU REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT"},{"name":"subject","value":"PRISONS AND PRISONERS"},{"name":"subject","value":"TERRORISM"}],"pub_date":"2011-03-06T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Magazine Desk","section_name":"Magazine","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Jennifer","lastname":"EGAN"}],"original":"By JENNIFER EGAN"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd2913d8eb7c8105d869ca8","word_count":8340},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/interactive\/2011\/03\/17\/greathomesanddestinations\/20110316uruguay.html","snippet":"A family\u2019s vacation home in Punta del Este was built on a plateau of sand to ensure the best possible view of the ocean.","lead_paragraph":"A family\u2019s vacation home in Punta del Este was built on a plateau of sand to ensure the best possible view of the ocean.","abstract":null,"print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"On Location | In Uruguay, Animal Hides and Ocean Waves"},"keywords":[{"rank":"1","is_major":"N","value":"Uruguay","name":"glocations"},{"rank":"2","is_major":"N","value":"Housing and Real Estate","name":"subject"},{"rank":"3","is_major":"N","value":"Restoration and Renovation","name":"subject"},{"rank":"4","is_major":"N","value":"Interior Design and Furnishings","name":"subject"}],"pub_date":"2011-03-17T00:00:00Z","document_type":"multimedia","news_desk":"Great Homes & Destinations","section_name":"Great Homes & Destinations","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"Interactive Feature","_id":"540bc9ce38f0d85e13e4ca33","word_count":"0"}]},"status":"OK","copyright":"Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
