This time, it may be viewed in an unusually well- composed show at the elegant new Herstand Gallery, 24 West 57th Street. The display, smaller than one held at Salander O'Reilly in 1981, numbers about 15 canvases dated 1938-48 and a few wood constructions of 1929-30. Maybe the best way of approaching this artist is by way of regular installments, since his life didn't exactly progress in linear fashion, but like his imagery, arranged itself in compartments. In the first of these, were 17 years he spent in his native Uruguay, evidently growing up an autodidact; the second was the Spanish period, when after having studied briefly in Barcelona, the artist worked as an assistant to the architect Antonio Gaudi, eventually becoming a muralist. Except for trips to Belgium and Italy, Torres-Garcia remained in Spain for almost 30 years, then took off for New York by way of Paris. Despite a friendly reception and a show at the Whitney Studio Club, the artist was not too happy in this country and after two years went back to France, remaining until 1932, when he went to Spain and, finally, to Montevideo.","abstract":null,"print_page":"22","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"ART: 15 LATER WORKS IN TORRES-GARCIA SHOW"},"keywords":[{"name":"subject","value":"TERMS NOT AVAILABLE"}],"pub_date":"1983-12-02T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Weekend Desk","section_name":"Arts","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Vivien","rank":1,"lastname":"RAYNOR"}],"original":"By VIVIEN RAYNOR"},"type_of_material":"Review","_id":"4fd14acb8eb7c8105d628309","word_count":1191},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1983\/12\/11\/world\/argentine-leader-sworn-into-office-ending-army-rule.html","snippet":"Raul Ricardo Alfonsin was inaugurated President of Argentina today amid joyous celebrations that ended nearly eight years of military rule.

More than 100,000 Argentines poured into the streets to cheer the 56-year-old political moderate as a sense of hope gripped this long-tumultuous country. Waving flags and wearing white berets, a symbol of Mr. Alfonsin's Radical Party, the crowds rained confetti on him as he traveled in a 1950's Cadillac convertible from the swearing in at the Congress to the Pink House, the presidential palace. Columns of cavalry marched by his side.","abstract":null,"print_page":"1","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"ARGENTINE LEADER SWORN INTO OFFICE, ENDING ARMY RULE"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"ALFONSIN, RAUL"},{"name":"persons","value":"IME MIN)"},{"name":"persons","value":"SOARES, MARIO"},{"name":"glocations","value":"ITALY"},{"name":"glocations","value":"PORTUGAL"},{"name":"glocations","value":"ARGENTINA"},{"name":"subject","value":"POLITICS AND GOVERNMENT (1983)"}],"pub_date":"1983-12-11T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Foreign Desk","section_name":"World","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Edward","rank":1,"lastname":"SCHUMACHER"},{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":2}],"original":"By EDWARD SCHUMACHER, Special to the New York Times"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd147408eb7c8105d622dd9","word_count":837},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1983\/12\/11\/nyregion\/four-amnesty-grups-active-in-county.html","snippet":"WHEN Carmen Popescu stepped into the bright August sunlight beyond her prison last summer in Bucharest, Rumania, guards handed her a food package from Dobbs Ferry.

The release of Mrs. Popescu, who had been jailed in 1981 for ''propaganda against the socialist state,'' had been the goal of Amnesty International Adoption Group No. 253, Hastings-Dobbs Ferry Chapter. The Amnesty International organization and its local chapters never claim credit for the release of a prisoner, although vigorous efforts may have been made in the process. The 15 teachers, homemakers and business executives in Adoption Group 253 wrote more than 100 letters to Rumanian officials, Congressional Representatives, State Department officials and to the press on Carmen Popescu's behalf. They sent food parcels at their own expense. Last spring, they held a vigil near the Rumanian Mission to the United Nations in New York City and accounts of the vigil were broadcast by Radio Free Europe.","abstract":null,"print_page":"1","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"FOUR AMNESTY GRUPS ACTIVE IN COUNTY"},"keywords":[{"name":"subject","value":"TERMS NOT AVAILABLE"}],"pub_date":"1983-12-11T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Westchester Weekly Desk","section_name":"New York and Region","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Tessa","rank":1,"lastname":"MELVIN"}],"original":"By TESSA MELVIN"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd13ce38eb7c8105d612f02","word_count":1549},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1983\/12\/13\/world\/argentine-ripples-touch-neighbors.html","snippet":"When Wilson Ferreyra Aldunate, an exiled Uruguayan opposition leader, came here as a specially invited guest for the inauguration Saturday of President Raul Alfonsin, he was interviewed by a leading Uruguayan newspaper.
