The announcement of improving commercial relations between the two countries came after a meeting here this week of the U.S.-U.S.S.R. Joint Commercial Commission, a body set up by the two Governments during a thaw in relations in 1972. The Soviet Foreign Trade Minister, Boris I. Aristov, who headed the Soviet delegation, said at a news conference that ''we would like to increase trade three and four times with you.'' He described trade as ''one of the oldest professions'' and the sector ''where confidence between our two nations can be achieved easier than in other fields.''","abstract":null,"print_page":"37","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"U.S. TO END ITS SOVIET NICKEL BAN"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"BALDRIGE, MALCOLM"},{"name":"glocations","value":"UNION OF SOVIET SOCIALIST REPUBLICS"},{"name":"glocations","value":"UNITED STATES"},{"name":"subject","value":"NICKEL"},{"name":"subject","value":"INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND WORLD MARKET"}],"pub_date":"1986-12-06T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Financial Desk","section_name":"Business","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"firstname":"Clyde","middlename":"H.","lastname":"FARNSWORTH","rank":1,"role":"reported","organization":""},{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":2}],"original":"By CLYDE H.

When he won, defeating two candidates long identified with socialist causes, the party was able to claim victory. It was a triumph of opportunism over ideology. In the gubernatorial and Congressional elections held here and throughout Brazil Nov. 15, the left in fact took a beating. Only where it joined forces with more conservative parties did it fare reasonably well - and even then Communists won just five seats in the new 487-member Congress. Otherwise, the left's radical message was generally ignored. The pro-Moscow Brazilian Communist Party now even regrets that it chose to ''go public'' as a legal party last year.","abstract":null,"print_page":"2","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"THE LATIN LEFT IS FREE TO BE UNPOPULAR"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"LATIN AMERICA"},{"name":"glocations","value":"BRAZIL"},{"name":"subject","value":"ELECTIONS"}],"pub_date":"1986-12-07T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Week in Review Desk","section_name":"Week in Review","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Alan","rank":1,"lastname":"RIDING"}],"original":"By ALAN RIDING"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd165ca8eb7c8105d652edf","word_count":808},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1986\/12\/14\/world\/for-brazil-and-argentina-new-amity.html","snippet":"Using such innocuous instruments as trade in onions and carrots, as well as more sophisticated exchanges on nuclear energy and biotechnology, Brazil and Argentina have begun burying their political rivalry and assuming the challenge of integrating...","lead_paragraph":"Using such innocuous instruments as trade in onions and carrots, as well as more sophisticated exchanges on nuclear energy and biotechnology, Brazil and Argentina have begun burying their political rivalry and assuming the challenge of integrating their economies. The moves, which gained momentum during a three-day visit here this week by President Raul Alfonsin of Argentina, have been compared to the postwar reconciliation of France and West Germany that established the political basis for creation of the European Community.

Early Santa Fe paintings depict sunlight sharply slanting off adobe walls and winter snow. For admirers of strong contrasts and color, Canyon Road - the city's gallery row - remains a special delight in winter: red dirt, brown adobe, white snow and a late-afternoon violet wash over all. Among the earliest artists to arrive on the road before World War I were Gerald Cassidy and Sheldon Parsons. In poor health, they came for New Mexico's curative mountain air and stayed to paint the strong light created by the blue desert sky and the bright sun. Mr. Cassidy bought an old adobe, salvaging beams from an abandoned 17th-century mission to repair a burned-out roof. Other artists followed: Fremont Ellis, John Sloane, and Randall Davey lived on Canyon and nearby Camino del Monte Sol from the 1920's on.","abstract":null,"print_page":"21","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"SANTA FE'S GALLERY ROW"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"NEW MEXICO"},{"name":"glocations","value":"SANTA FE (NM)"},{"name":"subject","value":"ART"},{"name":"subject","value":"TRAVEL AND VACATIONS"}],"pub_date":"1986-12-14T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Travel Desk","section_name":"Travel","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Stephen","rank":1,"lastname":"LEWIS"}],"original":"By STEPHEN LEWIS; Stephen Lewis is a writer who lives in Santa Fe, N.M"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd164e28eb7c8105d6515ca","word_count":2184},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1986\/12\/22\/world\/8-latin-countries-push-peace-talks.html","snippet":"Eight Latin American Governments have announced that the Secretaries General of the United Nations and the Organization of American States had agreed to join them in a new initiative aimed at reviving peace negotiations in Central America.

Crowds of demonstrators opposed to the bill gathered outside the Congress as the voting occurred just before midnight, and riot policemen filled the surrounding streets to assure safe exit for members of the Chamber of Deputies. Earlier in the evening, the majority leader of the Chamber, Cesar Jaroslavsky, was struck by demonstrators when he went outside briefly. The law establishes a period of 60 days for the continued filing of charges, but after that ''penal action will be extinguished'' on cases arising from the so-called ''dirty war'' against leftists. It was drafted under pressure from military leaders, who have argued that their actions during that era had ample public support.","abstract":null,"print_page":"15","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"LAW IN ARGENTINA ENDS PROSECUTION"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"ARGENTINA"},{"name":"subject","value":"ARMAMENT, DEFENSE AND MILITARY FORCES"},{"name":"subject","value":"MURDERS AND ATTEMPTED MURDERS"},{"name":"subject","value":"KIDNAPPING"},{"name":"subject","value":"LAW AND LEGISLATION"},{"name":"subject","value":"TORTURE"}],"pub_date":"1986-12-24T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Foreign Desk","section_name":"World","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Shirley","rank":1,"lastname":"CHRISTIAN"},{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":2}],"original":"By SHIRLEY CHRISTIAN, Special to the New York Times"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd165cb8eb7c8105d652f6b","word_count":655},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1986\/12\/28\/weekinreview\/the-world-new-peace-move-in-central-america.html","snippet":"The start of a new effort to revive peace negotiations in Central American was announced last week by eight Latin American governments, who said the Secretaries General of the United Nations and the Organization of American States would join them.  ...","lead_paragraph":"The start of a new effort to revive peace negotiations in Central American was announced last week by eight Latin American governments, who said the Secretaries General of the United Nations and the Organization of American States would join them.

But more notable, perhaps, was the indifference with which the law was greeted by most Argentines. They were concerned about Christmas and departures to the beach or countryside, so the opposition was left primarily to human rights groups and several small leftist political parties. Some observers here said this may indicate that many Argentines agreed with the military's argument that all share a burden for the excesses of an era in which doctors did not denounce torture, lawyers were afraid to file habeas corpus petitions, the Roman Catholic hierarchy was silent and the dominant newspapers generally took safe positions.","abstract":null,"print_page":"3","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"ARGENTINA AND URUGUAY PARDON SOME OLD ABUSES"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"ARGENTINA"},{"name":"glocations","value":"URUGUAY"},{"name":"subject","value":"ARMAMENT, DEFENSE AND MILITARY FORCES"},{"name":"subject","value":"POLITICS AND GOVERNMENT"},{"name":"subject","value":"FREEDOM AND HUMAN RIGHTS"},{"name":"subject","value":"TORTURE"}],"pub_date":"1986-12-28T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Week in Review Desk","section_name":"Week in Review","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Shirley","rank":1,"lastname":"CHRISTIAN"}],"original":"By SHIRLEY CHRISTIAN"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd165d68eb7c8105d6536c8","word_count":823}]},"status":"OK","copyright":"Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
