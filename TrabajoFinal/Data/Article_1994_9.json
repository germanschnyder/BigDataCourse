But voting in the hemisphere's second largest democracy -- which brought to power Fernando Henrique Cardoso, a former Foreign Minister and Finance Minister with big plans -- failed to draw any television crews from the hemisphere's largest democracy, the United States. Without a military coup to grab headlines or a nuclear bomb to inspire fear, Brazil is huge in just about everything but the amount of outside interest it generates. It has always been thus, it seems. Regardless of the global aspirations its leaders proclaimed and the country's obvious potential in resources, Brazil long failed to find the right political structure or, when it did, the right person to lead it from the third world to the world stage. First there were two decades of clunky military rule, then a transition to direct voting leading to the election of a youthful, smooth-talker who proved too smooth -- that is to say corrupt -- followed finally by his replacement with a safe but lackluster caretaker.","abstract":null,"print_page":"5","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"The World: Cardoso, the Global Salesman; Brazil Thinks Big, Again"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"CARDOSO, FERNANDO HENRIQUE"},{"name":"glocations","value":"BRAZIL"},{"name":"subject","value":"FOREIGN INVESTMENTS"},{"name":"subject","value":"INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND WORLD MARKET"},{"name":"subject","value":"ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND TRENDS"},{"name":"subject","value":"ELECTIONS"}],"pub_date":"1994-10-09T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Week in Review Desk","section_name":"Week in Review","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"James","rank":1,"lastname":"BROOKE"}],"original":"By JAMES BROOKE"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd1dc5a8eb7c8105d71da6c","word_count":881},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1994\/10\/16\/travel\/q-and-a-499994.html","snippet":"Freighter Travel  Q.

The paintings are small, the terrain is featureless and the figures vary slightly from one to the next. The result is a visually sleepy show, primarily of interest for what it documents: the landscape and culture of the Rio de la Plata region of Uruguay and Argentina, a part of the world largely unknown outside South America itself. Its outstanding visual chronicler was Juan Manuel Blanes (1830-1901), who was born and trained in Montevideo. While still in his 20's he established a reputation for painting contemporary political events, and as a witness to his country's devastating civil war, he had plenty of dramatic material to work from.","abstract":null,"print_page":"21","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Documenting Gauchos And Their Landscape","kicker":"ART REVIEW"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"BLANES, JUAN MANUEL"},{"name":"organizations","value":"AMERICAS SOCIETY"},{"name":"subject","value":"REVIEWS"},{"name":"subject","value":"SHOWS (EXHIBITS)"},{"name":"subject","value":"ART"}],"pub_date":"1994-10-21T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Weekend Desk","section_name":"Arts","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Holland","rank":1,"lastname":"COTTER"}],"original":"By HOLLAND COTTER"},"type_of_material":"Review","_id":"4fd1f4a18eb7c8105d74e044","word_count":785},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1994\/10\/31\/business\/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-accounts-687006.html","snippet":"* Ammirati & Puris\/Lintas, New York, has resigned from two accounts: Sterling Health U.S.A., New York, with billings estimated at $10 million for brands like Phillips' Milk of Magnesia, because of a conflict with the agency's Johnson & Johnson...","lead_paragraph":"* Ammirati & Puris\/Lintas, New York, has resigned from two accounts: Sterling Health U.S.A., New York, with billings estimated at $10 million for brands like Phillips' Milk of Magnesia, because of a conflict with the agency's Johnson & Johnson account, and Smart Money magazine, New York, because of its small size, with billings estimated at $500,000. * McDonald's Restaurants of Venezuela, Caracas, to Leo Burnett\/Caracas, to handle its account, previously at McCann-Erickson Publicidad, Caracas, and to open restaurants in Colombia and Ecuador.
