Victims cry for justice, but leaders of new regimes must decide to what extent it is possible, moral or prudent to pursue evildoers of the past. This question emerged in Chile, Argentina and Uruguay during the mid-1980's, when murderous military dictatorships gave way to freely elected civilian governments. Eastern European countries faced it a few years later, after the collapse of Communist regimes. More recently, South Africa and South Korea have brought high-ranking officials of past governments to trial in connection with bloody crimes.","abstract":null,"print_page":"7","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Word for Word\/On Trial in Germany;We Weren't Following Orders, But the Currents of the Cold War"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"KRENZ, EGON"},{"name":"persons","value":"SHABOWSKI, GUNTER"},{"name":"glocations","value":"GERMANY"},{"name":"glocations","value":"EAST GERMANY"},{"name":"subject","value":"IMMIGRATION AND REFUGEES"},{"name":"subject","value":"POLITICS AND GOVERNMENT"},{"name":"subject","value":"GUARDS"},{"name":"subject","value":"BOUNDARIESAND TERRITORIAL ISSUES"}],"pub_date":"1996-03-24T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Week in Review Desk","section_name":"Week in Review","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Stephen","rank":1,"lastname":"KINZER"}],"original":"By STEPHEN KINZER"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd1f0208eb7c8105d7456ba","word_count":1402},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1996\/03\/24\/world\/unity-cracking-as-american-nations-meet-on-an-economic-zone.html","snippet":"Shaken by election campaigning in the United States that has indicated voter  discontent over breaking down trade barriers, trade ministers from 34 North and  South American nations meeting here this week decided they would begin discussing the...","lead_paragraph":"Shaken by election campaigning in the United States that has indicated voter discontent over breaking down trade barriers, trade ministers from 34 North and South American nations meeting here this week decided they would begin discussing the structure of a Free Trade Area of the Americas next year.

The show began with worrisome hints that its new producer, Quincy Jones, would stop at nothing to make this staid ceremony more user-friendly, and might outdo even Hollywood in pandering to trashy popular tastes. So there was Oprah Winfrey greeting luminaries outside the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, treating last year's best supporting actress, Dianne Wiest, like a Miss America emeritus. (\"You're giving up the throne tonight. Is that hard to do?\") Subjected to a hard-hitting question from Ms. Winfrey, Elisabeth Shue admitted that a best actress nomination had not changed her and she still loved her dog.","abstract":null,"print_page":"13","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Energy, Gallantry, Graphics And Glamour at the Oscars","kicker":"TELEVISION REVIEW"},"keywords":[{"name":"subject","value":"MOTION PICTURES"},{"name":"subject","value":"ACADEMY AWARDS (OSCARS)"},{"name":"subject","value":"REVIEWS"},{"name":"subject","value":"TELEVISION"},{"name":"subject","value":"AWARDS, DECORATIONS ANDHONORS"}],"pub_date":"1996-03-27T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Cultural Desk","section_name":"Movies; Arts","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Janet","rank":1,"lastname":"MASLIN"}],"original":"By JANET MASLIN"},"type_of_material":"Review","_id":"4fd1f5078eb7c8105d74e7d6","word_count":689},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1996\/04\/07\/arts\/turning-an-ear-to-other-americas.html","snippet":"WHEN \"AMERICA\" IS used as a synonym for the United States, many Latin Americans object, arguing that the term should apply equally from Patagonia to Canada.

At stake is the future of the global telecommunications industry, and possibly of the World Trade Organization itself. The goal of the talks is to open domestic telecommunications markets to foreign companies, potentially saving consumers billions of dollars. But an agreement would also put many sluggish national telephone companies at risk of being trampled by more efficient foreign competitors.","abstract":null,"print_page":"1","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Global Talks Covering Phones Near Deadline"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"GENEVA (SWITZERLAND)"},{"name":"organizations","value":"WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION"},{"name":"subject","value":"INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND WORLD MARKET"},{"name":"subject","value":"TELEPHONES AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS"}],"pub_date":"1996-04-08T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Business\/Financial Desk","section_name":"Technology; Business","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Paul","rank":1,"lastname":"LEWIS"}],"original":"By PAUL LEWIS"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd1df5c8eb7c8105d7247a8","word_count":980},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1996\/04\/14\/business\/investing-it-it-keeps-your-pants-on-but-can-it-fatten-your-wallet.html","snippet":"WHEN a product is so common that it is used as a prop in a television show stunt, is it a sign that its potential for new uses has been played out?

Used in everything from clothing to spacecraft -- not to mention the wall-jumping stunt on \"The Late Show With David Letterman\" -- the fastener has even made a brief appearance in a Presidential election.

He came into office promising to bring a consensus style of policy-making to the White House -- no longer would a budget director like Richard Darman, who served under President Bush, bully everyone in sight. He also promised to direct Federal spending away from wasteful programs and toward future-looking investments in training people. How has he done? The record is mixed. He had many small successes and, in health and welfare reform, a few spectacular failures. On balance, Mr. Clinton did little harm and allowed the economy to prosper.
