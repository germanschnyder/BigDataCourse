The sources disclosed that paratroopers and Royal Marines had ousted Argentine soldiers manning small outposts on the summits of 1,504-foot Mount Kent and adjacent hills, from which Stanley is clearly visible in good weather. The hills form a sharp ridge overlooking a featureless plain leading to the capital and would give the British valuable positions for observation and possibly for artillery. British control of the whole ridge would expose enemy forces, bottled up on a thin finger of land jutting into the South Atlantic, to 105-millimeter howitzer fire from one direction and 4.5-inch naval gunfire from the other.","abstract":null,"print_page":"1","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"BRITAIN REPORTS SEIZING KEY HILLS OUTSIDE STANLEY"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"FALKLAND ISLANDS"},{"name":"glocations","value":"GREAT BRITAIN"},{"name":"glocations","value":"ARGENTINA"},{"name":"subject","value":"ARMAMENT, DEFENSE AND MILITARY FORCES"},{"name":"subject","value":"BOUNDARIES AND TERRITORIAL ISSUES"},{"name":"subject","value":"MILITARY ACTION"}],"pub_date":"1982-06-02T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Foreign Desk","section_name":"World; Front Page","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"qualifier":"Jr.","firstname":"R.","middlename":"W.","lastname":"APPLE","rank":1,"role":"reported","organization":""},{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":2}],"original":"By R.W.

Little more than a village, the settlement, which has a peacetime population of just over 1,000 and is the only real town in the Falklands, is on a narrow strip of land on the east coast of East Falkland Island surrounded by some of the wettest and roughest terrain in the entire colony. But it has one key feature that made it an ideal site for a colonial port - a deep, almost landlocked harbor connected by a narrows to an even deeper semiprotected outer harbor known as Port William.","abstract":null,"print_page":"14","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"A FINE HARBOR WON STANLEY ITS PLACE AS ISLANDS' CAPITAL"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"FALKLAND ISLANDS"},{"name":"glocations","value":"STANLEY (FALKLAND ISLANDS)"}],"pub_date":"1982-06-03T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Foreign Desk","section_name":"World","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Robert","rank":1,"lastname":"McG"}],"original":"By ROBERT McG.

The brief communique was the first word in 24 hours from the Argentine armed forces about any new military action in the Falklands, known here as the Malvinas. But various Argentine officials sought during the day to play down the decisiveness of the expected final battle for control of the islands. Brig. Gen.

Their emotions will be charged by the World Cup tournament, which will be played in Spain at 16 stadiums in 14 cities, starting with a game in Barcelona between Argentina and Belgium, and ending July 11 with the final in Madrid. The final at Santiago Bernabeu Stadium will attract a worldwide television audience expected to be more than one billion. For the first time, there will be 52 matches because there are 24 countries participating, eight more than the previous 16. The tournament actually kicked off on March 26, 1980, with qualifying matches between Cyprus and Ireland, and Israel and Northern Ireland. In all, 106 countries took part. There were 306 games played to determine the 22 qualifiers who would join Argentina and Spain, the automatic qualifiers as the defending champion and the host, in the 12th tournament. Despite the war between Britain and Argentina over the Falkland Islands, Federation Internationale de Football Association, the governing body and organizer of the World Cup, has been assured that all the teams will participate.","abstract":null,"print_page":"3","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"SOCCER'S BIGGEST EVENT: A LOOK AT THE WORLD CUP"},"keywords":[{"name":"subject","value":"SOCCER"}],"pub_date":"1982-06-06T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Sports Desk","section_name":"Sports","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Alex","rank":1,"lastname":"YANNIS"}],"original":"By ALEX YANNIS"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd123f98eb7c8105d5e8a0b","word_count":2001}]},"status":"OK","copyright":"Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
