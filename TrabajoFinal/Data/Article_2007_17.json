Germany, France, Italy, Israel, Dubai and Uruguay are some of the places that have jumped into the business of farming sturgeon for caviar. California was one of the earliest to develop a caviar industry and now, more than 15 years of experience have paid off with consistent quality from the two producers, Sterling and Tsar Nicoulai. They are likely to be the least expensive sources for good caviar this season. Both companies offer several grades from a type of sturgeon called transmontanus, or white sturgeon, from basic black to some with larger beads and paler hints of gold and gray, at higher prices. It all has to do with how the roe is sorted as it is harvested. Samples purchased from www.sterlingcaviar.com and www.tsarnicoulai.com, showed stylistic differences between the products; which to choose is a matter of taste.","abstract":"Food Stuff column; California producers Sterling and Tsar Nicoulai are offering several grades of caviar from farmed sturgeon this holiday season; photo (S)","print_page":"2","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Fresh From the Farm, California Caviar"},"keywords":[{"name":"organizations","value":"STERLING CAVIAR"},{"name":"organizations","value":"TSAR NICOULAI"},{"name":"subject","value":"CAVIAR"},{"name":"subject","value":"FISH AND OTHER MARINE LIFE"}],"pub_date":"2007-12-12T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Dining, Dining Out\/Cultural Desk","section_name":"Arts; Dining and Wine","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Florence","lastname":"FABRICANT"}],"original":"By FLORENCE FABRICANT"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd264d68eb7c8105d8180be","word_count":267},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2007\/12\/19\/world\/americas\/19briefs-gay.html","snippet":"Congress legalized gay civil unions in the first nationwide law of its kind in Latin America.","lead_paragraph":"Congress legalized gay civil unions in the first nationwide law of its kind in Latin America.","abstract":null,"print_page":"14","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"WORLD BRIEFING | THE AMERICAS; Uruguay: Gay Unions Approved","print_headline":"WORLD BRIEFING | THE AMERICAS; Uruguay: Gay Unions Approved"},"keywords":[{"rank":"1","is_major":"N","name":"glocations","value":"Uruguay"},{"rank":"2","is_major":"N","name":"subject","value":"Homosexuality"},{"rank":"3","is_major":"N","name":"subject","value":"Law and Legislation"},{"rank":"4","is_major":"N","name":"subject","value":"Marriages"}],"pub_date":"2007-12-19T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Foreign","section_name":"World","subsection_name":"Americas","byline":{"person":[],"original":"By REUTERS","organization":"REUTERS"},"type_of_material":"Brief","_id":"548952e938f0d82a67123ac5","word_count":"24"},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2007\/12\/24\/arts\/24open.html","snippet":"The National Center for the Performing Arts, a $400 million complex, has attracted at least as much attention for its cost overruns, safety concerns and provocative aesthetics.","lead_paragraph":"The National Center for the Performing Arts, a $400 million complex, has attracted at least as much attention for its cost overruns, safety concerns and provocative aesthetics.","abstract":null,"print_page":"1","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"width":600,"url":"images\/2007\/12\/24\/arts\/24openspan.jpg","height":260,"subtype":"xlarge","legacy":{"xlargewidth":"600","xlarge":"images\/2007\/12\/24\/arts\/24openspan.jpg","xlargeheight":"260"},"type":"image"},{"width":75,"url":"images\/2007\/12\/24\/arts\/24open75.jpg","height":75,"subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"thumbnailheight":"75","thumbnail":"images\/2007\/12\/24\/arts\/24open75.jpg","thumbnailwidth":"75"},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"seo":"National Center for the Performing Arts of China - China - Performing Arts","main":"Chinese Unveil Mammoth Arts Center","print_headline":"Chinese Unveil Mammoth Arts Center"},"keywords":[{"rank":"1","is_major":"N","name":"subject","value":"Culture"},{"rank":"2","is_major":"N","name":"glocations","value":"China"}],"pub_date":"2007-12-24T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Culture","section_name":"Arts","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Joseph","rank":1,"lastname":"KAHN"}],"original":"By JOSEPH KAHN"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"54896ea138f0d82a67123f6b","word_count":"1174"}]},"status":"OK","copyright":"Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
