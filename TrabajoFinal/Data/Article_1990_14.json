But the President and Congressional leaders have grown increasingly wary of the anger of voters over the inability to reach agreement on governing the nation's finances. And they are worried about the danger that the protracted political warfare poses for the weakened national economy. Legislators who vote for this legislation will do so holding their noses for varying reasons. Some will say it raises gasoline taxes too much, others that it raises them too little to improve conservation and reduce dependence on foreign oil. Some dislike the plan because it hits Medicare too hard, others because it does not hit Medicare and other entitlement programs hard enough. And the plan defers the question of how to reorganize the military budget in light of the reduced Soviet threat and new threats like those in the Middle East.","abstract":null,"print_page":"2","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Economic Scene; A Budget Accord None Too Soon"},"keywords":[{"name":"creative_works","value":"ECONOMIC SCENE (TIMES COLUMN)"},{"name":"glocations","value":"UNITED STATES"},{"name":"subject","value":"UNITED STATES ECONOMY"},{"name":"subject","value":"FINANCES"},{"name":"subject","value":"PRODUCTIVITY"},{"name":"subject","value":"BUDGETS AND BUDGETING"}],"pub_date":"1990-10-26T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Financial Desk","section_name":"Business","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Leonard","rank":1,"lastname":"Silk"}],"original":"By Leonard Silk"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd1b23d8eb7c8105d6d5581","word_count":780},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1990\/10\/29\/business\/international-report-us-is-changing-its-tune-on-liberalization-of-trade.html","snippet":"After years of pushing for an end to nations' restrictions on financial, engineering, communications and other services, Washington is losing some of its enthusiasm for liberalization.
