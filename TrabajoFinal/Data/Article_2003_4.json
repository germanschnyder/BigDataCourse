He also did not have a chance to stop Dallas's lone goal, he did not yield a rebound and he did not make a mistake (the same cannot be said for Burn keeper D.J. COUNTESS) in a 2-1 overtime victory. MetroStars Coach BOB BRADLEY could not have asked for more from Walker, who was obtained last week by the MetroStars to replace TIM HOWARD, who signed with Manchester United. Walker, 28, has a tough act to follow. A native of California who played at the University of Louisville, Walker had played professionally in Chile since July 1997 and is the only American to have played in the Libertadores Cup, the South American club championship, according to the MetroStars.","abstract":null,"print_page":"7","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"MetroStars' New Goalie Shines in His First Game","kicker":"SOCCER: NOTEBOOK"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"2003-07-22T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Sports Desk","section_name":"Sports","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Jack","rank":1,"lastname":"BELL"}],"original":"By JACK BELL"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd22c5d8eb7c8105d7b88b8","word_count":1189},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2003\/07\/31\/world\/aguaviva-journal-by-enticing-foreigners-villages-grow-young-again.html","snippet":"''Don Luis!
