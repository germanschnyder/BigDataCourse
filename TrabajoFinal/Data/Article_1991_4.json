Those who talked of breaking the 125-day barrier seemed daring. But their estimates now seem conservative given the breakneck speed at which the top solo skippers are approaching the finish line in Newport after 27,000 miles at sea. With the first yachts expected to begin arriving Tuesday, an elapsed sailing time of 120 days, not counting rest stops along the way, seems likely.","abstract":null,"print_page":"7","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Global Speed Mark Likely to Be Broken","kicker":"YACHTING"},"keywords":[{"name":"creative_works","value":"BOC CHALLENGE (SAILING RACE)"},{"name":"subject","value":"RACES AND REGATTAS"},{"name":"subject","value":"SAILBOATS AND SAILING"},{"name":"subject","value":"BOATS AND BOATING"}],"pub_date":"1991-04-21T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Sports Desk","section_name":"Sports","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Barbara","rank":1,"lastname":"LLOYD"}],"original":"By BARBARA LLOYD"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd1c1998eb7c8105d6f0d5b","word_count":834},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1991\/04\/21\/books\/there-is-a-woman-stuck-in-my-throat.html","snippet":"THE BOOK OF EMBRACES    By Eduardo Galeano.
