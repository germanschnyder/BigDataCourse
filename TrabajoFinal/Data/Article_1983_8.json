Miss Zorrilla, who was born in Uruguay and is now based in Buenos Aires, performed it for two years in Argentina and toured with it elsewhere in Latin America. She will appear at the Hunter College Playhouse, Park Avenue at 68th Street, tonight at 8, tomorrow night at 5 and 8, and Sunday at 3 and 6 P.M. Tickets: $15 ($7 for students).

The incident reminded some delegates of other such outbursts - including dancing in the aisles - that apparently showed general pleasure at American embarrassments, such as the time in 1974 when Yasir Arafat, the Palestine Liberation Organization leader, was allowed to address the Assembly and the vote in 1980 electing Nicaragua to the Security Council. Similar anti-American sentiment seemed to be operating here Wednesday when the 158-member Assembly, after agreeing to skip a debate, voted overwhelmingly to deplore the United States invasion of Grenada. Not only the Soviet bloc and the developing countries, which are often known as the ''automatic majority,'' voted in favor of the resolution; not a single member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, nor such other friendly countries as Pakistan, Thailand and Egypt, voted with the United States.","abstract":null,"print_page":"18","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"BEHIND U.N.

The Venezuelan, Jose Alberto Zambrano Velasco, said in an interview that the four nations - Colombia, Mexico, Panama and Venezuela, known as the Contadora group - were seeking to move swiftly because of high tensions in the region after the American-led invasion of Grenada and because of a conviction that efforts for peace in the area had reached ''a critical moment.'' In talks last week in Caracas, he said the Venezuelan Government had found Daniel Ortega Saavedra, a member of Nicaragua's governing junta, ''very worried'' about the threat of American intervention in Central America and ''really receptive'' to suggestions for a treaty that would not only ban clandestine arms traffic and other forms of support for rebel groups but also also require steps toward democracy in Nicaragua as well as other countries. Mr. Zambrano said the Foreign Ministers of the four nations planned to meet Wednesday morning to review the treaty, which was prepared by their deputy ministers and technical experts, and that the Colombian Foreign Minister was due to arrive here late tonight for the meeting. If the draft is approved, he said, it will be submitted to Nicaragua, El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala, and Costa Rica.","abstract":null,"print_page":"3","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"LATIN NATIONS PLAN NONAGGRESSION PACT"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"SEPULVEDA, BERNARDO"},{"name":"persons","value":"GALLIMORE, NEVILLE"},{"name":"glocations","value":"CENTRAL AMERICA"},{"name":"glocations","value":"VENEZUELA"},{"name":"glocations","value":"COLOMBIA"},{"name":"glocations","value":"LATIN AMERICA"},{"name":"glocations","value":"PANAMA"},{"name":"glocations","value":"SURINAME"},{"name":"glocations","value":"GRENADA"},{"name":"glocations","value":"JAMAICA (WEST INDIES)"},{"name":"glocations","value":"BRAZIL"},{"name":"glocations","value":"BOLIVIA"},{"name":"glocations","value":"URUGUAY"},{"name":"glocations","value":"MEXICO"},{"name":"organizations","value":"CONTADORA GROUP"},{"name":"organizations","value":"UNITED NATIONS"},{"name":"organizations","value":"AMERICAN STATES, ORGANIZATION OF"},{"name":"subject","value":"UNITED STATES INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS"},{"name":"subject","value":"INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS"},{"name":"subject","value":"ARMAMENT, DEFENSE AND MILITARY FORCES"},{"name":"subject","value":"TREATIES"},{"name":"subject","value":"MILITARY ACTION"},{"name":"subject","value":"UNITED STATES ARMAMENT AND DEFENSE"}],"pub_date":"1983-11-16T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Foreign Desk","section_name":"World; Washington","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Hedrick","rank":1,"lastname":"SMITH"}],"original":"By HEDRICK SMITH"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd13cea8eb7c8105d61357f","word_count":635},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1983\/11\/19\/world\/the-talk-of-riyadh-for-saudis-cleanliness-godliness-wealthiness.html","snippet":"This city is invaded each day by an army of 3,000 Sri Lankans.

Armed with brooms and mechanized street sweepers, they advance quietly and efficiently through the city's markets and grand boulevards. Their mission is to keep Riyadh clean. The results are staggering, Saudis and foreigners agree. Ten years ago Riyadh was one of the dirtiest, dustiest cities in the Middle East. Today the city is relatively spotless. Nevertheless, Rodney R. Proto, managing director of Browning-Ferris Saudi Arabia Ltd., a joint Saudi- American venture that has a five- year, $233 million contract to clean the city, is not satisfied.
