The agreement not only averts a ruinous trade war, but also unleashes the all-important international trade talks, known as the Uruguay Round, that were stalled by the farm dispute. Yesterday's settlement will benefit consumers around the world. Though details are sketchy, the agreement appears to be a reasonable compromise.

But in an era in which everything from cars to cheese already seems to come from another country, does the apparent breakthrough in negotiations on a grand world trade deal really matter? The answer, say most, if not quite all, economists, is a resounding yes. International trade has been a great engine of prosperity for the last century and shows every promise of remaining one in the next. And while the gains from trade have become far trickier to analyze than the old textbooks make them out to be, the basic logic -- more is better -- has not changed.","abstract":null,"print_page":"1","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Economic Watch; Although Trade Is Trickier, 'More Is Better' Is Still True"},"keywords":[{"name":"subject","value":"INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND WORLD MARKET"},{"name":"subject","value":"PROTECTIONISM (TRADE)"},{"name":"subject","value":"ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND TRENDS"}],"pub_date":"1992-11-23T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"National Desk","section_name":"Front Page; U.S.","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Peter","rank":1,"lastname":"PASSELL"}],"original":"By PETER PASSELL"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd1e3f58eb7c8105d72e14b","word_count":1130},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1992\/11\/23\/business\/trade-tug-war-breakthrough-was-result-gamble-last-minute-idea.html","snippet":"Friday's breakthrough in a six-year trans-Atlantic stalemate on farm subsidies was the result of a daring gamble by the United States last month and a last-minute idea by the European Community, participants in the talks said in extensive interviews...","lead_paragraph":"Friday's breakthrough in a six-year trans-Atlantic stalemate on farm subsidies was the result of a daring gamble by the United States last month and a last-minute idea by the European Community, participants in the talks said in extensive interviews over the last three days.

The clash between the two forces was clearly in evidence last week as the United States and Europe reached a compromise in their incipient trade war -- and farmers, politicians and others in France reacted furiously to the deal.
