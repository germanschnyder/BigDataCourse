Haig Jr. arrived here tonight and said the Reagan Administration's improved relations with Argentina were ''a good basis'' on which to resolve the Falkland Islands crisis. Mr. Haig, however, arriving from London in the hope of averting a possible war between Argentina and Britain, cited last week's United Nations Security Council resolution as the foundation for a diplomatic solution. The resolution calls for the Argentines to withdraw their troops from the disputed South Atlantic island, but the resolution was opposed by Argentina. Argentina says it will not withdraw, as Britain demands, until Britain recognizes Argentine soverignty over the islands and its right to administer them.","abstract":null,"print_page":"6","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"HAIG, IN BUENOS AIRES, SAYS U.S. TIES WITH ARGENTINA FORM BASIS FOR TALKS"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"FALKLAND ISLANDS"},{"name":"glocations","value":"GREAT BRITAIN"},{"name":"glocations","value":"ARGENTINA"},{"name":"subject","value":"INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS"},{"name":"subject","value":"BOUNDARIES AND TERRITORIAL ISSUES"},{"name":"subject","value":"UNITED STATE INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS"}],"pub_date":"1982-04-10T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Foreign Desk","section_name":"World","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Edward","rank":1,"lastname":"SCHUMACHER"},{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":2}],"original":"By EDWARD SCHUMACHER, Special to the New York Times"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd11fd18eb7c8105d5e01e4","word_count":1027},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1982\/04\/10\/theater\/2-stars-named-for-beyond-therapy.html","snippet":"John Lithgow and Dianne Wiest, who is now appearing as Desdemona in ''Othello'' at the Winter Garden, will star in Christopher Durang's ''Beyond Therapy,'' which will open at the Brooks Atkinson Theater on May 24.

Joining Mr. Lithgow and Miss Wiest will be Kate McGregor-Stewart, Peter Michael Goetz and Jack Gilpin, with Miss McGregor-Stewart and Mr. Gilpin repeating the roles they did in the earlier production.

The economic sanctions, adopted at a meeting in Brussels, were the sternest punitive measures taken by the 10-nation European Economic Community in its 25-year history. Officials said the ban on imports, along with a cutoff of arms sales to Argentina approved Friday, could be imposed as early as Wednesday if legal documents were completed in time.
