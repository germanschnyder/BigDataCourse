When I phoned Dawson to introduce myself and invite him for a drink, he cut me off, insisting, ''But you're coming to me today!'' - a perfect example of how Tangier society and its famous grapevine works. I had had dinner the night before with the retired antiques dealer Christopher Gibbs, whose clients-slash-chums have included everyone from Jaggers to Rothschilds, and before the last morsel had been downed, a big lunch party at Dawson's was already in the works. In Tangier, you are only as grand as your rooftop terrace. Dawson's tops off an apartment house that's a little more distinguished than most buildings in the scrappy Ville Nouvelle, the architecturally neutral (and that's being kind) ''New City,'' much of which went up after Morocco became a French and Spanish protectorate in 1912. Smothered in bougainvillea, Dawson's terrace has jaw-dropping views of the port, Gibralter and Spain, not 10 miles across the strait. The table service at lunch was French, expertly executed by my host's majordomo, a dwarf in a fez whom he rescued from a hard life on the streets, so it was difficult to be blase.","abstract":"Christopher Petkanas travel article on visit to Tangier, Morocco, city of expatriates starved for amusement and always looking for the next party; photos (L)","print_page":"113","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"The Last Casbah"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"TANGIER (MOROCCO)"},{"name":"glocations","value":"MOROCCO"},{"name":"subject","value":"PARTIES (SOCIAL)"},{"name":"subject","value":"TRAVEL AND VACATIONS"}],"pub_date":"2011-05-22T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"T: Travel Magazine","section_name":"Travel; Magazine; Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Christopher","lastname":"PETKANAS"}],"original":"By CHRISTOPHER PETKANAS"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd2b8c98eb7c8105d8aed86","word_count":2371},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2011\/05\/26\/world\/asia\/26iht-srgaASIA26.html","snippet":"Citing its broader inclusiveness, some experts said the Group of 20 might be a better forum for discussing global financial issues than the Western-dominated Group of 8.","lead_paragraph":"Citing its broader inclusiveness, some experts said the Group of 20 might be a better forum for discussing global financial issues than the Western-dominated Group of 8.","abstract":null,"print_page":"","blog":[],"source":"International Herald Tribune","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"As G-8 Meets, Asian Leaders Seek a Bigger Role","print_headline":"As G-8 Meets, Asian Leaders Seek a Bigger Role","content_kicker":"Special Report: G-8"},"keywords":[{"rank":"1","is_major":"N","value":"Group of Eight","name":"organizations"},{"rank":"2","is_major":"N","value":"Group of Twenty","name":"organizations"},{"rank":"3","is_major":"N","value":"Far East, South and Southeast Asia and Pacific Areas","name":"glocations"}],"pub_date":"2011-05-26T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Foreign","section_name":"World","subsection_name":"Asia Pacific","byline":{"contributor":"","person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Sonia","rank":1,"lastname":"KOLESNIKOV-JESSOP"}],"original":"By SONIA KOLESNIKOV-JESSOP"},"type_of_material":"Special Report","_id":"5405f7aa38f0d81983bde280","word_count":"1072"},{"web_url":"http:\/\/intransit.blogs.nytimes.com\/2011\/05\/30\/latino-artists-on-display-at-london-fair\/","snippet":"Latin American exuberance will pervade the Pinta Latin American Art Fair, from June 7 to 9 at the Earls Court Exhibition Center in London.","lead_paragraph":"Latin American exuberance will pervade the Pinta Latin American Art Fair, from June 7 to 9 at the Earls Court Exhibition Center.
