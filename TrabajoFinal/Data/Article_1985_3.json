Since 1958, this organization has presented more than 300 world premieres and many more first United States performances. At first, the festival was held every three years; in 1976, it became an annual event. On Monday night, a group from Chile (with the decidedly non- Latin name of Ensemble Bartok) opened the 1985 festival with a program of recent music by South American composers.","abstract":null,"print_page":"28","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"CONCERT: FESTIVAL OF CANADIAN AND LATIN MUSIC"},"keywords":[{"name":"subject","value":"MUSIC"},{"name":"subject","value":"REVIEWS"},{"name":"subject","value":"CONCERTS AND RECITALS"}],"pub_date":"1985-04-18T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Cultural Desk","section_name":"Arts","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Tim","rank":1,"lastname":"PAGE"}],"original":"By TIM PAGE"},"type_of_material":"Review","_id":"4fd151638eb7c8105d633304","word_count":503},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1985\/04\/24\/business\/business-people-top-executive-shift-planned-at-nv-philips.html","snippet":"Wisse Dekker, 60, the president and chairman of N.V.

Moreover, the United States, which had worked so hard all these years to keep the Cubans isolated, now finds itself increasingly alienated in the hemisphere because the Latin Americans are convinced that the Reagan White House does not care about their awesome economic crisis and Fidel Castro does. In historical terms, the shift in Latin American attitudes toward President Castro is vastly more important than, say, the Reagan's Administration's defeat in the Congress over funding of the Nicaraguan ''contras.'' However, one has the impression that the Administration does not even remotely understand this fact and its dangerous long-range impact on United States influence in the region.","abstract":null,"print_page":"25","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"CUBA'S EMERGENCE, AMERICA'S MYOPIA"},"keywords":[{"name":"subject","value":"TERMS NOT AVAILABLE"}],"pub_date":"1985-05-05T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Editorial Desk","section_name":"Opinion","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Tad","rank":1,"lastname":"Szulc"}],"original":"By Tad Szulc; Tad Szulc, a Washington-based writer, is working on a biography of Fidel Castro"},"type_of_material":"Op-Ed","_id":"4fd1620f8eb7c8105d64d0a1","word_count":1082},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1985\/05\/11\/movies\/godard-has-a-bad-day-in-cannesand-tries-to-withdraw-hail-mary-in-italy.html","snippet":"A festival that has so far been nearly as drab as the weather at this supposedly sunny seaside resort was briefly enlivened today when a middle-aged man threw a cake topped with shaving cream at the director who used to be the intellectual hero of...","lead_paragraph":"A festival that has so far been nearly as drab as the weather at this supposedly sunny seaside resort was briefly enlivened today when a middle-aged man threw a cake topped with shaving cream at the director who used to be the intellectual hero of the French film industry, Jean-Luc Godard. The cake-thrower, who was hustled away by security guards after the incident, identified himself only as ''George the whipped-cream-splatterer'' and ''the mutilator of icons.'' The cake, which hit Mr. Godard square in the face, was the third blow of the day for the director. First, Italian film distributors refused to withdraw his film ''Hail Mary'' after he asked them to do so.

The stereotype is that the torturer - a brutal police interrogator, for example - is driven by a warped sadism. But more commonly, some psychologists say, torturers are often not sadists so much as otherwise normal people who under certain circumstances sink into a routine of intimate horror in which they hurt or mutilate another human being, while staying aloof from the screams and agony of their victims. What circumstances can lead someone who may well consider himself a decent person to commit such inhumane acts, blind to the reality of the secret monster he has become? The puzzle takes on all the more urgency in New York now because of the recent allegations of torture made against a group of New York City police officers.","abstract":null,"print_page":"1","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"THE TORTURER'S MIND: COMPLEX VIEW EMERGES"},"keywords":[{"name":"subject","value":"MENTAL HEALTH AND DISORDERS"},{"name":"subject","value":"RESEARCH"},{"name":"subject","value":"TORTURE"}],"pub_date":"1985-05-14T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Science Desk","section_name":"Science; Health","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Daniel","rank":1,"lastname":"GOLEMAN"}],"original":"By DANIEL GOLEMAN"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd14d4f8eb7c8105d62c9b9","word_count":1941},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1985\/05\/19\/world\/castro-builds-relations-with-south-america.html","snippet":"After more than two decades of rejection and isolation, Fidel Castro is building new relationships in South America, dispelling many old suspicions and succeeding in dimming his image as a threatening revolutionary, many diplomats say.

In the last year, Cuba has received a $600 million loan from Argentina. The right-of-center President of Ecuador, Leon Febres Cordero, made a formal visit to Cuba in April, and there have been signs that Uruguay, Peru and possibly Brazil may soon re-establish full diplomatic relations with Cuba. Cuba remains without diplomatic relations with Colombia, but Western diplomats and Cuban officials say that Mr. Castro has developed a personal relationship with President Belisario Betancur and that the two speak by telephone several times a week. In early May, Mr. Castro sent a shipment of medical supplies to Bolivia and 15 buses to Guyana. Both were gifts.","abstract":null,"print_page":"1","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"CASTRO BUILDS RELATIONS WITH SOUTH AMERICA"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"CASTRO, FIDEL"},{"name":"persons","value":"SKOUG, KENNETH N JR"},{"name":"glocations","value":"LATIN AMERICA"},{"name":"glocations","value":"CUBA"},{"name":"organizations","value":"STATE, DEPARTMENT OF"},{"name":"subject","value":"UNITED STATES INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS"},{"name":"subject","value":"INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS"}],"pub_date":"1985-05-19T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Foreign Desk","section_name":"World; Washington","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1}],"original":"By JOSEPH B.
