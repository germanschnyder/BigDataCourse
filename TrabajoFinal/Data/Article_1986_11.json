They wore civilian clothes but they carried guns and were almost certainly soldiers. They took Jorge, a former student activist, to a makeshift jail where they tortured him for 24 hours straight. Jorge's wrists and ankles still bear deep scars from the manacles that locked his hands and legs behind his back while electric shocks were applied to all parts of his body. It is his only proof of a seven-week secret incarceration many North Americans find difficult to comprehend. ''For Canadians, a prisoner is someone who did something wrong,'' says Jorge, who asked that his last name not be used because he fears for the safety of relatives in Guatemala. But last year, he said, a 2-year-old boy with his fingernails pulled out was found among some corpses. ''What could a 2-year-old boy do to be killed?'' Jorge asks.","abstract":null,"print_page":"18","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"SALVAGING LIVES AFTER TORTURE"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"ALLODI, FEDERICO A"},{"name":"persons","value":"BERGER, PHILIP"},{"name":"organizations","value":"TORTURE, CANADIAN CENTER FOR INVESTIGATION AND PREVENTION OF"},{"name":"subject","value":"COMPANY AND ORGANIZATION PROFILES"},{"name":"subject","value":"MENTAL HEALTH AND DISORDERS"},{"name":"subject","value":"TORTURE"}],"pub_date":"1986-08-17T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Magazine Desk","section_name":"Health; Magazine","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"firstname":"Christopher","middlename":"S.","lastname":"WREN","rank":1,"role":"reported","organization":""}],"original":"By CHRISTOPHER S.

But the Federal Government's efforts to help those still on the farm have strained relations with some of Washington's closest allies.
