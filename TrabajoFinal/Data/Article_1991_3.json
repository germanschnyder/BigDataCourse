Counterinsurgency operations against foreign-supported guerrillas, a unifying mission since the 1950's, have faded with the decay of Cuba and the Soviet Union. Border disputes, long a pretext for maintaining standing armies, are increasingly papered over in the name of regional economic integration. And the idea of ruling the country seems to have lost its appeal. So the armies, many with shrinking budgets, are now grappling to define their mission in the 1990's. Some of them have accepted Washington's offer of aid and training in return for joining the war on cocaine. Others are practicing the capitalism they long preached by running profitable businesses like transport companies, uniform manufacturers and gold mines.","abstract":null,"print_page":"2","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"The World; Latin Armies Are Looking for Work"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"LATIN AMERICA"},{"name":"subject","value":"COUPS D'ETAT AND ATTEMPTED COUPS D'ETAT"},{"name":"subject","value":"ARMAMENT, DEFENSE AND MILITARY FORCES"},{"name":"subject","value":"POLITICS AND GOVERNMENT"}],"pub_date":"1991-03-24T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Week In Review Desk","section_name":"Week in Review","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"James","rank":1,"lastname":"BROOKE"}],"original":"By JAMES BROOKE"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd1c9dd8eb7c8105d6fd864","word_count":973},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1991\/03\/25\/business\/business-digest-667591.html","snippet":"The Economy    A wave of new taxes and tax increases appears to be developing in states, counties and cities.

It was the kickoff last month of Chile's 1992 International Air and Space Show, the pride of the Chilean military. Though the name may connote something less bellicose, the air show is the largest display in Latin America of technology and hardware to kill and wage war. Grenades, cluster bombs, Uzi submachine guns, artillery, radar systems, helicopter gunships and a host of fighter jets were on view.
