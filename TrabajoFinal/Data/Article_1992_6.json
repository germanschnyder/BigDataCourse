The words were casual but the accomplishment is not. The two countries have settled many of the issues blocking a free trade agreement that American exporters and investors will find enticing. Mexico has agreed to open up its banking and securities industries to U.S. investors by the year 2000 and has accepted provisions that would prevent Japanese and other foreign manufacturers from gaining unfair access to the U.S. market via Mexico. Meanwhile Mr. Bush is making good on his promise to push through a treaty that would help Mexico and Canada, the other participant.","abstract":null,"print_page":"26","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"A Breakthrough on Mexican Trade"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"BUSH, GEORGE"},{"name":"glocations","value":"UNITED STATES"},{"name":"glocations","value":"MEXICO"},{"name":"subject","value":"UNITED STATES INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS"},{"name":"subject","value":"MEXICO-INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS-US"},{"name":"subject","value":"INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS"},{"name":"subject","value":"INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND WORLD MARKET"},{"name":"subject","value":"EDITORIALS"},{"name":"subject","value":"TREATIES"}],"pub_date":"1992-07-17T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Editorial Desk","section_name":"Opinion","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"Editorial","_id":"4fd1d4128eb7c8105d711310","word_count":332},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1992\/07\/19\/sports\/barcelona-a-viewers-guide-demonstration-sports-pelota.html","snippet":"HOW IT'S DONE: The exact origins of this demonstration sport are difficult to trace.

Some believe the game evolved from one played in Central Europe by the ancient Romans and Greeks; others say there is evidence the ancient Egyptians created the game. Still others believe the explorer Hernan Cortes brought the game back to Europe after raiding what is now Honduras. Both the French and English claim to have created the game as well. What is certain, however, is that the modern version of pelota came out of the Basque country in the western Pyrenees of France and Spain. Games were originally improvised using the exteriors of church walls as backstops, part of the reason so many churches in the Basque region today still include frontons.","abstract":null,"print_page":"10","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"BARCELONA - A VIEWERS GUIDE: Demonstration Sports; PELOTA"},"keywords":[{"name":"subject","value":"TERMS NOT AVAILABLE"}],"pub_date":"1992-07-19T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Sports Desk","section_name":"Sports","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Gerald","rank":1,"lastname":"ESKENAZI"}],"original":"By GERALD ESKENAZI"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd1dd0a8eb7c8105d71f37c","word_count":533},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1992\/07\/19\/sports\/barcelona-a-viewers-guide-the-sports-soccer.html","snippet":"HOW IT'S DONE: The Olympic soccer tournament has changed formats over the years, but it remains an event snubbed by the powerhouse nations of the world.

Lately, one exhibition after another, including a gigantic survey of Latin American art from 1920 to 1970 at the Bronx Museum a few years ago, has set out to broaden that perception. The latest effort is sharply focused and thoughtful. As part of the Smithsonian Institution's program to celebrate the cultural legacy of Latin America on the quincentenary of 1492, the Hirshhorn Museum here has organized \"Crosscurrents of Modernism: Four Latin American Pioneers\" (through Sept. 7).
