Normally, when you call `func` as a bound method to an instance `c` as `c.func()` this is converted to `Child.func(c)`, where `c` is the instance `self` in the method definition.

However, I would consider `null` being passed to a function either 1) A normal falsey value 2) A special sentinel value, depending upon the function contract. As you point out, however, the conditional check does catch both, so if both cases are expected to be caught, it has the same semantics."
