The starting x, y coordinates of the swipe are established in touchStart event. There, too, you assign the startPos to endPos, the default ending position. In the touchMove listener you keep noting the current coordinates, making these the endPos coordinates. In touchEnd you note the difference between startPos and endPos. So, either jQuery is exposing the startPos and endPos coordinates in its swipeLeft event, or you have to wire up your own plug-in to accomplish this outside of jQuery."

I have many years of programming in many different languages behind me, but this is the first time I've ever tackled JS/PHP.  So you are recommending I have a separate file for my php calls and JS functions?  &#xA;&#xA;I am understanding your menu idea, JS idea, but the part list does not need a join of any sort and I do already have my DB mapped out/created.

This should help: [Best Practices for Exception Handling](http://onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/2003/11/19/exceptions.html). If I were you. 1. Check connection in `onCreate()` - show dialog when not connected. 2. Connection and parsing is long running task. I would do it in AsyncTask. In case of exception show dialog with message and `finish()` or try to recover - it depends on you. It's important to show descriptive error message when it's occured."

  <row Id="8255446" PostId="6914106" Score="0" Text="@Obalix - Your first statement is correct. The issue is with notifying of changes, where you are assuming the DataContext is changed. If you have `window.DataContext = someObject;`, then there is no way to know to update the DataContext based on someObject alone. If you have `DataContext={Binding SomeObject}`, then again from SomeObject you cannot update the DataContext, only the object that has the SomeObject property can do that. Using the `Self` property allows SomeObject to update the binding to itself." CreationDate="2011-08-03T15:02:12.697" UserId="142794" />
