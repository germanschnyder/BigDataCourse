And the `__new__` method selects the correct one by using the class as its hash, creating it if not already done. In my version each class had access to only its own instance, or the base instance if that had been created, and then the `__new__` method checks that it is an instance of the correct class.

So in this case, the floating point result is cast to an int (and thus truncated) before being stored. So `fmilo` is functionally equivalent to `array_ *= 0.67328`. To get the desired rounding behavior, you have to do something like `rint((array_ * 0.67328), array_)`. But on my machine that's actually slower than slice assignment."
