They use variety of data: say 80 data items (matrices) and the names of these matrices are not sequential (i.e. say 'ni' 'equity' etc and NOT mat1, mat2 etc.).  OOP approach is not possible as these 300 functions are grouped into 7 categories.  Dataitems are used across all categories.  By making them global, you can easily use them anywhere.  Inside function you assign global values to local matrices and do your stuff.  What else would work?  OOP approach is not possible for now.  Thanks!"

So if he writes a word, and then pauses for like 250ms, then is the time to do that Ajax-request. `$.debounce` does that for you - it executes the function only if the user typed something and then stopped for moment (250ms in my example)."

One last question, I am digging through the docs but couldn't find an answer easily...how deep does the recursion go?

If I retrieve the &quot;user&quot; data, I see the associated roles, but I would like to also automatically have another level of recursion where each role has the hours associated with it.
