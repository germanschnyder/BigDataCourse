I think you should consider Marty Wallaces first solution for anything less explicit than play from frame 5 to frame 30. Since that solution is more robust for the general case. I would however move the `onEnterFrame` function out of `playSegment`, and place it in it's own function, since that makes the code much easier to read and comprehend. That's just my personal preference though, his code works just fine as it is." CreationDate="2011-08-01T09:11:33.320" UserId="417768" />

I also think a lot of us *(and the older/more experienced we are)* when writing code know **exactly** the types we need use (except the cases you specified), so using `auto` instead of explicit type would require in some cases more mental work to prove to oneself that it's the same. Being explicit with compiler is not a bad thing. Maybe with time that burden of using `auto` will go away." CreationDate="2011-08-01T17:06:52.110" UserId="491591" />
