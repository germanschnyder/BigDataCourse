What actually happens is that a/x is mathematically undefined at x = 0, but the function is extended by continuity by taking the limit as x -&gt; 0+.  This limit is taken not in the usual real numbers, but in the two-point compactification of the real numbers, so it is +infinity.  If 0 were merely treated as though it were &quot;really small&quot;, then division by zero would signal overflow. However, it does not; the result is an *exact* infinity instead."

It hard to say without seeing our complete project. ViewController are just classes that act as go-betweens of the function of you app (model) and how that function is presented to the user. I have only briefly look at ASIHTTPRequest so maybe it is self contained model class in itself in which case making your view controller a delegate of it is a reasonable solution."
