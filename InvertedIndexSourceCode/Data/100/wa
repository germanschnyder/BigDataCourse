If i understand the question right way, you could use the &quot;tag&quot; property of the &quot;UIView&quot; class which is inherited in UIButton.

The point of using a Stream with Streaming mode is that, if you don't, the entire request/response must be buffered into memory before being dispatched/returned from yoru WCF service. Obviously if your messages are large in size this will not scale very well. As far as SOAP vs. REST, I won't really get into that here, but I highly recommend doing some reading on REST to see if it's a good fit for what you're trying to build with this service."
