A back branch is a branch of the original graph that when looked at in the context of the DFS tree/forest connects a node to its ancestor. There is no such branch in your example and it is easily provable that there exists such a branch iff there is a cycle. You're getting confused with a cross branch, which will point to a visited node, but doesn't indicate the existence of a cycle.
