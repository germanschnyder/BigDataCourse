For instance, for Win/x86 you must make sure that the objects you point to are always 4-byte aligned. If that invariant holds true, then the low two bits are &quot;guaranteed&quot; to be 0, i.e., (ptr &amp; 0x3) == 0. In this case we can use these low pointers to store data. On Win/x86-64 Windows guarantees that the top 16-bits are &quot;0&quot;; you can use these bits to store your tag.

It also looks like it requires an index that must be modified everytime you add a file (to map the string to the command).  This isn't really what I am looking for.  I want to be able to edit any file, not just files included in the current file.  One problem with `ctags` is that the file I get when I say `:tabe Foo` could change depending on my environment.  This could probably be fixed by a complex enough command, but then why wouldn't I just use that command?" CreationDate="2011-06-24T11:57:27.403" UserId="78259" />

Internally, `memset` dereferences the pointer, and pointer dereferencing (`operator*`) is an lvalue expression, which is then used to modify the object *pointed to*.
