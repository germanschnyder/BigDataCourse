The simplest way to guarantee that is to retain the request and cancel (and release) it in dealloc. If you don't retain it, the cancel call may call an already deallocated object (if the request has already completed), which would then result in a crash. If you have a better way, please do post your own answer!" CreationDate="2011-06-13T08:32:34.863" UserId="292166" />

The first argument of the event handler contains a reference to your List instance (equivalent to the variable 'ListDemo.listPanel' in your example). The 'index' argument refers to the place in the List the tapped item falls e.g. 1st list item tapped gives index = 0, second item tapped gives index = 1 etc. For simple use cases you can ignore the item and e arguments - plus i'm running out of space.. :)" CreationDate="2011-06-13T11:19:40.853" UserId="108848" />

I'm not sure exactly what you're asking, but another way to implement it would be to have the `Queue` block forever on the gets, but put something to indicate that your producers are done onto the `Queue` and have the main thread break out of the while loop when it sees that all the producers are done."
