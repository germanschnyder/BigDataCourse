It does, however, explain why buffer objects are read only: because buffers have always been read only from code written in Python, so we need to call a read-write buffer available to Python code something else (a memoryview)."

For `NSURLConnection` you can prevent a crash by calling `cancel` on the connection object, but for a background thread that's in the middle of processing data, you can't necessarily cancel the operation, and you don't want to pull the rug from under it."
