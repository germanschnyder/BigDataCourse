What I like about ionCube is it is very common in shared hosting environments so it shouldn't be a big issue for a WordPress plug-in. Think about how you will handle the auth requests if your own auth server crashes or the data facility goes offline for any reason meaning the app cannot get permission to run when it should be allowed to run. Maybe creating a key with a hidden day/month/year expiry value that can be locally stored and then the remaining characters need to equal a certain value to be accepted to run should the auth server be unavailable?"

Wouldn't worry about a few extra draw calls, unless you have tens of them. Alternatively, you can use multi-texturing, see [http://softwareprodigy.blogspot.com/2009/08/multitexturing-on-opengl-es.html] for a good example.

While reading tutorials/books about any new programming language I recommend trying the code out, and think of some situations where that piece of code would be helpful, write some simple use cases for that code, so you'll construct some patterns that you can use later. It takes longer to go through books like this but it's worth it because when you want to use that code later you know what to expect from it and are somewhat familiar.
