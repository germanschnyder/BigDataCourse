Now, using `input_string = InputString[]`, we can get the input from the C program, which will be the matrix to double.

I'm new to programming, so are retry statements acceptable in the Ruby world for clauses like this? Or is it the lazy man's way out? Thanks!"

I would have proceeded to say: if the array is still empty select twos then fours etc etc. But without embedded loops i think this code would look terribly ugly. Unless there is no way of using embedded loops. Basically, to answer your question, the program is not currently written to simulate a round in its entirety. As long as the program can be tested whenever there are threes or ones in the array it is sufficient for my purposes--which is solely to learn how to code."
