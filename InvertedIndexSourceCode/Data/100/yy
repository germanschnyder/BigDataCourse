You should probably test this on keyup, paste (which won't trigger a key event if done via the menu) and on drag'n'drop, which I'm assuming will give a mouseup (I've never tested it).

ObservableCollection is a special type of generic collection which fires collection changed notification when items are added, removed, etc, which in turn causes bindings to be updated. A plain List will not do this so if you bind your view to a list then the combobox items will not change by simply changing the items in the list (if you use ObservableCollection then they will)."
