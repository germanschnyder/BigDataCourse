In the answer I linked to, I gave a single line DOM-based solution, which was readable, maintainable and robust, whereas a regex solution would have been more code, slower, and liable to breakage if the HTML changed. It's not religious; it's common sense. I actually enjoy regex, and I use it a lot, but only when it's the right tool for the job. Given a small and consistent piece of HTML, regex is indeed a good tool, and I do use it then, but HTML code that needs to be searched is rarely small or consistent.
