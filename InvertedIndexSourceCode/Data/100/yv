It's been a while since I used OGL though, but I think you're simply looking for Index Buffer Objects (IBO). Nothing prevents you from making your VBO's &quot;upload once&quot;, and in fact they *should be* as far as possible. But you're mixing two different discussions here. The way OpenGL renders a quad is, on the CPU side, to split it into 4 vertices, and 6 indices, uploading those, and rendering two triangles from them. And that is exactly what you should do as well if you don't use GL_QUAD, so there is zero extra overhead" CreationDate="2011-07-13T13:01:08.683" UserId="33213" />

My guess is that this is basically a random Battleship game generator type thing, and you can't have overlapping ships.

Somebody is holding a `shared_ptr` longer than it is supposed to, so the object is never deleted. This is easily caused by circular references... `a` holds `b`, which holds `c`, which holds `a`, so none of them ever get deleted even if nothing external references `a`. Consider using `weak_ptr` in places wher actual ownership is not neccessary. Also, your lambdas might get stored somewher along the path, and they hold copies as well."
