In an inmutable class you can set the object state when creating an instance of the class but once created, you can never modify it. For example: `string s = &quot; hello &quot;; s.Trim();` will not modify `s` (it will still be `&quot; hello &quot;`). `Trim()` however will return a new string with the new value `&quot;hello&quot;`. The same happens with `UInt16`, you set the value when creating it: `Uint16 x = 4;` There is no way you can modify the value of a UInt16 instace once created."
