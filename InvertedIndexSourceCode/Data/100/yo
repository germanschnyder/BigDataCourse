And about the results that these two functions return are JUN and MAY. For example, the function ADD_MONTHS(SYSDATE, -1) returns 08/06/2011 09:10:50 and adding SUBSTR(ADD_MONTHS(SYSDATE, -1),4,3) it gets just the month, in that case JUN. And thanks for your advise, I will do this instead: SUBSTR(ADD_MONTHS(TO_DATE(SYSDATE,'DD/MM/YYYY'), -1),4,3)" CreationDate="2011-07-08T08:24:55.867" UserId="833428" />

Try calling `GetErrorMode` right after the failure, to see what's its current value. If it had changed, there's your problem. One lesson to learn if you develop a DLL - always consider the possibility someone has called SetErrorMode before, and consider masking the existing value according to your need...
