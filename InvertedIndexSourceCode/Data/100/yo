And about the results that these two functions return are JUN and MAY. For example, the function ADD_MONTHS(SYSDATE, -1) returns 08/06/2011 09:10:50 and adding SUBSTR(ADD_MONTHS(SYSDATE, -1),4,3) it gets just the month, in that case JUN. And thanks for your advise, I will do this instead: SUBSTR(ADD_MONTHS(TO_DATE(SYSDATE,'DD/MM/YYYY'), -1),4,3)" CreationDate="2011-07-08T08:24:55.867" UserId="833428" />

Try calling `GetErrorMode` right after the failure, to see what's its current value. If it had changed, there's your problem. One lesson to learn if you develop a DLL - always consider the possibility someone has called SetErrorMode before, and consider masking the existing value according to your need...

All the socket knows is that it's got a connection to another endpoint and that it will be receiving/sending bytes.

You can actually read this content. Furthermore if the window is at the lowest level and pixel ownership test is not performed on glReadPixels you can do live captures.

So, when I'm iterating through the subtypes, I check if one matches the hiddensubtypeid and then select it, then I clear out the hiddensubtypeid so that subsequent calls to the getJSON (i.e, when the user selects a different main type) it won't select a subtype.  I guess I could key off of the original main type and subtype so that  if the original main type was selected, it could re-select the original subtype.  Is that basically what you're saying?
