The thing is, I would like the user to be able to program the robots, i.e., each robot has an underlying 'operating system'.  Ideally they could program the robot in smalltalk, but any scripting language would be fine for me.  The reason I don't think processes would work in one image is that if you write a script for one robot, this script should not have access to any other robots in the image, or be able to change the game state beyond what is locally possible for that robot."

On the second thing, I've updated the answer to put `.panel` where it should be, I missed that it was a separate constructor function.
