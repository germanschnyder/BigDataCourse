The plugin also binds `load` and `error` to all image elements and also checks for `image.complete` in case an image is in cache (in which case `load` won't fire).  The crux of the issue is that even though an image is loaded, its `height` and `width` properties won't necessarily have updated yet.  This behavior is especially inconsistent in Chrome, I find.  I think we figured out how to wait for all images to load.  Now we have to figure out how to hook into the height &amp; width being set." CreationDate="2011-05-25T01:54:07.570" UserId="132931" />
