After merging processed chunks, you would be back to a single-machine environment where PK collision would be immediately detected, and easily handled.

The plugin also binds `load` and `error` to all image elements and also checks for `image.complete` in case an image is in cache (in which case `load` won't fire).  The crux of the issue is that even though an image is loaded, its `height` and `width` properties won't necessarily have updated yet.  This behavior is especially inconsistent in Chrome, I find.

If the video tag only includes an MP4 file you'll get nothing in Firefox - even if you have a Flash fallback.

Here's an example: http://jsfiddle.net/mdg77/1/ It works in Chrome/Safari which supports MP4. It works in IE thanks to the Flash fallback. But it won't work in Firefox because Firefox doesn't support MP4. But since Firefox does support the video tag - we don't see the Flash fallback."

But ideally, we would like to get a passing unit test in place *before* refactoring. So I wrote the unit test against the `OddEven` class as presented. Once there is a passing unit test, we can refactor. Additionally, there exists a school of thought among unit testing zealots that says that all things static are evil.
