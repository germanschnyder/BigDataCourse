An unbounded turing machine examining the remainder+state at the half-way point only needs the state to distinguish between n/2 possibilities instead of n choose n/2. That only proves a `logarithmic` space bound (note: the log comes from the high values requiring more bits, you can call it constant-size in practice)."

The problem is that (for me at least) any code I write is liable to have bugs in it, and that includes resource cleanup code (in fact, such code seems to be particularly bug-prone). Pretty much any time I am writing code, I am introducing bugs. In this case, if I leave it alone the OS does it just fine with very well-exercised code. My overriding goal at nearly all times is to write as little code as possible. I'm not going to go out of my way to add more bugs to my programs when I don't need to."
