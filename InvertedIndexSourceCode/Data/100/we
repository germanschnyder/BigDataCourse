Sure `AnsiString`s are null-terminated, so can be cast to `PAnsiChar`s, except that they also have a reference count at a negative offset - ie if data is passed to the DLL using your recommended structure and the pointer is interpreted in Delphi code as a genuine `AnsiString`, it could cause a lot of trouble. Safer to make a `PAnsiChar` that and only that. (Also, why ANSI?  It's 2011.  Make it a Unicode string.)
