I can get the count 4 of the  distinct records using NOT LIKE, but now I want to get the V record to substract it from the previous count, which by the way is not the number I want because that will give me 3. In other words, the V means (Void), so I want to know how many transactions not void I have, so I can´t count 999 as transaction becuase it was voided with 999(V)."

A major reason that people ask unclear questions is that they misunderstand the language or have mistaken assumptions about it and don't realize that their questions are unclear. Also some people asking questions here are barely out of diapers and lack the experience and language skills to ask good questions. So it's too much to *expect* clarity in every case. OTOH, it should not be too much to expect more experienced hands to see beginners' errors and to refrain from claiming that ORing a bunch of character values &quot;should work&quot; for ANYTHING that the OP is trying to do."
