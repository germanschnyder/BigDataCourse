It's either disk I/O or threading overhead. To rule out disk IO, load all of the xml into a List as strings and then parse them single threaded vs. threadpool. If threadpool is still slower, then threading overhead is more expensive than the xml parsing. If threadpool is faster, then disk I/O was the problem. If disk I/O is the problem, then you could try @dvhh's suggestion of creating a single thread to do disk I/O and use ThreadPool to parse in parallel."

My application uses a tabbed interface and while the 1st tab isn't overly burdensome it's still worth considering what it's doing with regards to being re-instantiated so many times.  My app is conducive to utilizing an in-memory cache for the 1st tab so it's likely I'll start there ;)  Thanks." CreationDate="2011-06-09T14:05:24.953" UserId="617044" />

Well, I am running Windows XP, and don't have a *real* email server, but I did run the debugging server that is built in to Python's smtplib - `python -m smtpd -n -c DebuggingServer localhost:1025`. From the docs, it just prints the output to console, so I would think it doesn't change any formatting. In any case, it didn't affect the problem."
