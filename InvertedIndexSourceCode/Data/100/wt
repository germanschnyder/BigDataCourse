The backslash in front of `^@` is so `^` is not read as 'begin of line' special char.  So what's happening is (1) null chars get converted to two char `^@`, then each occurrence of two char sequence gets substituted with space char.

Putting initialisation always in the constructor is consistent and you can easily see what the initial state of a class is.  You also have direct control over the order in which initialisation takes place.  In a trivial static class case there probably isn't much difference.

UIWebView allows you to load a local HTML string using loadHTMLString http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/uikit/reference/UIWebView_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40006950-CH3-SW10" CreationDate="2011-06-03T23:51:59.770" UserId="392178" />
