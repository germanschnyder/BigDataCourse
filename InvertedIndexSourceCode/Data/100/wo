But: 1) why do they have separate documentation for Payflow Gateway and Payflow Pro on x.com? 2) There are 2 types of solutions: API-based (for programmers) and HTML-based (for web-masters), am I right? 3) Payflow pro, Express checkout, Website payments pro are API based. Payflow link and website payments standart are HTML based? 4) I want to use API-based. What is the difference between payflow pro, express checkout and website payments? When use what? 5) Which one I need to accept reccuring payments and could I do it for credit-cards (not paypal accounts only)? Thanks!" CreationDate="2011-05-31T13:15:27.490" UserId="697633" />
