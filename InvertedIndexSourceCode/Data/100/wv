Ultimately, XML serialization is the best way to convert between data structures and XML.  Unfortunately, it's going to be more work.  You'll be happier coding against the end result, though, than if you tried to work directly against XML, or if you write an XML -&gt; data converter that doesn't use XML serialization."

If I'm not wrong in Edit3 you can find a non-null 'set' fragment which is part of the activity state and then call replace(...) with it so you would get the exception as it's already added. I think adding to the back stack is possibly unecessary. If you simply have a menu list with each entry invoking a different fragment in a right pane then you might get away with calling 'add' on each (don't call addToBackStack) and simply hide/show as required.

With two int fields representing the two cards, you could index (card mod 4), for the suit, and the needed formula that yields the card's rank. You can also create partial indexes, e.g. index hands with pairs, or hands with one or more aces, etc. And you'd end up doing all of your statistics on a single, astutely built table."
