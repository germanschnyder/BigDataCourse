So the $n$th number is called $x_n$, and the $(n+1)$th is called $x_{n+1}$.  The formula of @gereeter means that in particular, $x_8=\sin(\exp(x_7))$, $x_{21}=\sin(\exp(x_{20}))$, and so on. If you prefer, you could call the first number $f(1)$, the second number produced $f(2)$, and so on. Then the formula would read $f(n+1)=\sin(\exp(f(n)))$."

Problem is, sometimes the programmer is wrong, and it infact becomes zero on fridays.
