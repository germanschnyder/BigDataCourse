I only know that updateDisplayList is not the best place by far, even though it's a very convenient one for the programmer.

Hmm, the documentation on creating a REST API using ASP.NET MVC is a bit spotty, so since you're not familiar with ASP.NET MVC, I will refer you to http://www.codeproject.com/KB/WCF/RestServiceAPI.aspx, which describes how to create a REST API with WCF. But whether you use SOAP or REST, the principle is the same: create a layer of code that translates between your web service API and your .NET long-running asynchronous API."

A little research reveals that a Java &quot;char&quot; is still just 16 bits, but they've now added additional functions to peruse a string and return code points as int's rather than char's. So okay, if we need to support the latest incarnation of Unicode, we'd need a bigger array. Assuming each entry is an int, that's still a mere 400k, not impossible, though it is starting to get big. I suppose if Unicode 7 supports 32 bit values an array approach is starting to get impractical." CreationDate="2011-06-02T19:42:47.420" UserId="103206" />
