The reason your example works is that open-uri by default does not send an Accept-Encoding header, hence most webservers just return text/html. Once the page gets too big SOME servers seem to compress the page anyway, disregarding the missing Accept-Encoding..and that's when open-uri fails. Anyway..your solution works, but not because of the reason you thought." CreationDate="2011-07-02T21:07:19.907" UserId="823617" />

First the system goes through the array constructing a new array for `array_keys()`, then it goes through it again in the `foreach()`.
