There are some implicit integer conversions, but they're irrelevant because they're not *user-defined* conversions. When converting the (explicit) `A` to `C`, only one user-defined conversion is used: `A::operator C()`. So your code sample is not comparable to mine. I bet that it won't compile if you write `C c = x`, because then `x` would undergo *three* user-defined conversions, which is forbidden by the standard. See David's answer for details."
