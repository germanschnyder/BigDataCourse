I guess I misunderstood clip -- I don't think it's doing polygon testing; it's constructing a per-pixel map of which pixels to ignore when drawing, so it makes sense that it'd be faster. Note that I was planning to have a background behind the circle by then drawing it on top of another canvas, but that would be even slower. So I'll go with clip. Thanks!"

It may very well be the case, but note that `Block`-ing `RuleDelayed` and then defining `f` globally inside `Block` does not change things - probably because the code invoked internally when we use `Set` or `SetDelayed` is a low-level version of what we see with local rules.

You basically create an action link on your webpage (view) and maps to an action on a controller. Best thing to do would be check out the tutorials on asp.net site. http://www.asp.net/mvc That was the most helpful to me (esp creating a small app). Also, look for items by Scott Hanselman. Finally, be sure you're using mvc v3. It's not installed on VS2010 by default (as it was released post-vs2010), so you will have to download and install."

That's why you need the include guards (or `#pragma once`) to prevent it from copying and pasting it more than once.
