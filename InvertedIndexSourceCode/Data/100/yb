The usual way to instantiate a COM object is to call CoCreateInstance, giving it an 128-bit CLSID (which is an UUID) of a class, *and* an 128-bit IID (which is an UUID) of an interface, which the class must provide. It looks up that CLSID in the registry, which gives it a server, DLL or EXE. It then asks that server for an instance. It asks the instance for the interface. I'm a bit vague on how that instantiation works for an EXE server, which is your case. However, for a DLL it's a simple object factory provided by the DLL (well known function).

Some FP languages are definitely slower, but Haskell has often been shown to be nearly as fast as C, so if you know what you are doing you could probably get similar performance.
