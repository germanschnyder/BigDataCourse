It is exact for a lot of numbers, but not for all numbers (for which the decimal expansion IS finite and limited to about 15 or 16 decimals (in the case of double precision)). So the representation is NOT exact (in general), since there is no mapping from decimal expansion (which is the usual way to write literals in) to binary expansion that results in an error of 0.
