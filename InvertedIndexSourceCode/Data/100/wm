I am actually programming a website, where users will create and sell stories, so editing is only one aspect of it. I want my users to be able to rewind back and compare their changes, and let people who are reading their stories (potential buyers) to be able to check recent changes. The programming problem is there in the sense that I must choose the appropriate version control sub-system to interface with in the server side (either that or maybe implement one myself)."

This is a stronger condition-for example, `Union` given only `SameQ` has no choice but to be quadratic complexity (pairwise comparisons), while with `Order` it in principle can be `n log n`, since `Order` can be used to sort the list (in practice built-in `Union` will always be quadratic in `n` with explicit test, alas)."
