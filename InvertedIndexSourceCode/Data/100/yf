The reason it looks choppy is that every change in the DOM activates a (partitial) reflow (reprint). This meens that after `style.marginTop = '10px';` will be the _first_ reflow, the next after `style.marginLeft='10px';` and so on. You have to put all styles at once on the element e.g. `elem.setAttribute('style', 'margin-top: 10px; margin-left: 10px;...');`. But this won't work in older IEs."

  <row Id="7714664" PostId="6547942" Score="0" Text="+1, the real problem with this query is the way the data is stored.  Whenever you do crazy string manipulations on your data to get a needed value, that is a red flag for a bad design. If a column contains several &quot;parts&quot; that when split apart have individual meanings, you should store them as individual columns.  Example, if you have a column &quot;PersonName&quot; and you store it as &quot;first middle last&quot;, everything will be fine until you need to search and/or sort your data by last name. At that point you can use a ridiculous string split routine or create 3 columns: FirstName, MiddleName, LastName." CreationDate="2011-07-01T13:04:17.680" UserId="65223" />
