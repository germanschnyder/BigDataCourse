In the example I gave the bytes were coming from MD5, but they could just as well come from Java's [Random.nextBytes](http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/Random.html#nextBytes(byte[])) function.  In this case the question would be: when we generate a sequence byte arrays `b1, b2, b3 ...` and interpret a subchain as an integer (for example `b2[3-7]`), will the two subchains have a high or low correlation coefficient?"

This is the reason why good practice is to make finalizable objects as small as possible and without references to other objects (a private small finalizable &quot;handle wrapper&quot; helper object is better than making a &quot;big&quot; object finalizable)."

On Linux, typically you'll start out with one stack page plus a few guard pages; if you fault on a guard page, the stack is expanded. The thread may continue growing its stack until it hits some other mapping, at which point it'll SIGBUS. This'll be even harder to account for soon - there is work ongoing for discontiguous stacks; when you run out of space in your stack, it'll just switch you to a new stack segment; when the function returns, it'll switch back to the old stack."
