So for a given XML file, I parse the tag, obtain tag name, then I put `set` in front of the tag name to generate `setter method`. For example, after parsing tag `Name`, I change it to `setName`, I then using reflection to invoke the `setName` method, like this `Method method = PackageLabel.class.getDeclaredMethod(methodName, String.class); method.invoke(this, value);`. I know reflection is costly. Would you say that JAXB are doing something similar or JAXB is much more optimize than this." CreationDate="2011-06-16T21:07:48.083" UserId="240337" />
