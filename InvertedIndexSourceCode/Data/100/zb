Based on my requirements I actually need to display two time pickers (Start Time and End Time), and dynamically update their value based on the user selection. E.g.: if the user selects a Start Time greater than the End Time, the latter should be updated with the same value as the Start Time. How can I achieve this using some javascript? Thanks."

I'm not exactly one of them, but where possible I do believe it is better to encapsulate functions that rely on external variables in classes of their own, where you can import everything you need in a way that makes sense. What I meant by aliasing the variable is doing something such as: `function name($varname) { $var = $GLOBALS[$varname]; switch($var) { /* .. */ } }` as it's simply cleaner. Variable-variables can be confusing at best of times.. But I think it's mainly down to personal preference :)" CreationDate="2011-07-18T07:39:21.300" UserId="698179" />

You have to test how long it takes to serialize your object; this does not only depend on the pure size of it, but also on how it's being serialized. A JPEG image for example might be small when written to disk, but has a high CPU cost for the compression. Another important point to consider is whether your objects will all be (more or less) the same or if there are cases (user input?) where there's significantly more data to serialize."

For example you can store 0.5 or 0.25 or (0.5+0.25) or (0.25+0.001953125). Storing 0.251, 0.26 or 0.261 is not possible, you can only approximate them.

You will traverse first tree node-by-node, so that will be O(n). That is right. But once you do `BinarySearch` in the second tree and find the corresponding node in second tree, there onwards you have to again match node-by-node. Hence you will traverse second tree in log n * n time, that will be O(n). And hence total complexity will be O(n ^ 2). (O(n) for first and O(n) for the second tree)."
