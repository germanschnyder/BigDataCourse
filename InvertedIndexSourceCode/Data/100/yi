The point is that for *sequence* containers finding by value is linear in time, no matter what. But in `vector` you have the additional burden of moving memory around, while in `list` the actual removal (once you *found* an element) is essentially free -- that's the whole point of the `list` container, and that's why it has its own special member function. Also, the generic algo needs random access iterators, which `list` doesn't have. (That's why it also has it's own `sort` member.)" CreationDate="2011-07-04T14:37:04.810" UserId="596781" />
