To explain that, first consider that for each parent only their first-born child is relevant. A second-born child cannot add more information to the ancestors than the first-born child. @btilly's algorithm accounts for this - when the second born child is processed, the parent will already be marked as being a parent, and the DFS will halt immediately.

But what happens is, when you say String s = &quot;abc&quot;, if &quot;abc&quot; is not in the constant pool, memory is allocated for it and the literal is added to the pool. Next time you say String x = &quot;abc&quot;, it refers to the same instance, and no new object is created (thus no memory allocation). But if you say new String(&quot;abc&quot;) then memory is allocated for the new instance. Therefore, unless you know how those Strings are created, you can't say this much of memory is used. And by the way, PermGen is also part of the heap." CreationDate="2011-05-28T17:44:07.493" UserId="279320" />

As to the order, I'm not sure I would do that the way they did in the example, I would go for the casting to `long` as wih the previous two cases. I think your question should be addressed to the writers of the FAQ. Technically there's nothing wrong with the way they did it, but in real life you would probably not do it that way. If you do cast to `int` (which is smaller than `long` in their example), you would probably need to cast the result, because the interim may be larger, as they did."
