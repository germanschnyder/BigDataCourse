No worries I wasn't expecting an exact number of threads etc. What I'm working on is a web service so my plan was to have my service add the jobs to Amazon's SQS (Simple Queuing Service).

This can be very fast, especially if the map's sorted first on a simple type like an `int` or `double` that's rarely or never the same (the key might contain other discriminatory fields thereafter). Even strings that dont' share long common prefixes can be compared quickly. Still, `map` lookups can hit more memory pages than a hash map. You really should use a profiler before investing time in changing your implementation." CreationDate="2011-06-14T04:07:48.083" UserId="410767" />

  <row Id="7422132" PostId="6343434" Score="0" Text="You are not avoiding looping through every `DataRow` though. It's only hidden in the implementation details of the extension method. Something to consider: I am not sure the extension method turns off the datatable's notifications, index maintenance, and constraints while loading rows. This can have a significant performance impact as it has to check and update everytime a row is added contrary to using `BeginLoadData` and `EndLoadData` where the checks are only done once at the end. Check documentation or compare load times with the method I propose in my answer." CreationDate="2011-06-14T12:58:34.253" UserId="767890" />
