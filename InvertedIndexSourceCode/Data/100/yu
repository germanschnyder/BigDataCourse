But could you please give me more described sample of `DocumentInfoRepository`? It will be very helpful for my newbie experience. The issue of my question is that I need to get all data for `Document` and `DocumentInfo` classes in one place which is `Document` controller. There's two instances, but info gathering process in one place. It would be very good to get one all info in one place for one DB query." CreationDate="2011-07-13T10:17:11.273" UserId="799007" />

You are passing `NameType` instead [`NameType::string operator()` is not considered, if the LHS has non-`std::string` (here `ostream`) type]. Try to pass `NameType` with typecasting to `std::string`, then it will work, because now you are explicitly passing `std::string`." CreationDate="2011-07-13T10:17:45.707" UserId="514235" />

Also, do you know how it would behave it it tried to display a frame that hadn't been loaded already?
