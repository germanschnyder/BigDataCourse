  <row Id="7635416" PostId="6493036" Score="1" Text="One minor correction.  In the top-level context, `this` refers to the element with id = 'contact-form'.  The token `$(this)` is actually saying invoke the `$()` function with a parameter of `this`, and does not actually &quot;refer&quot; to anything itself.  It returns a jQuery wrapped version of the node.  But since you are in a context where `this` already points to a jQuery wrapped element calling `$(this)` is idempotent and can be omitted.  You can work directly with `this` and get exactly the same result." CreationDate="2011-06-27T12:52:03.197" UserId="609251" />
