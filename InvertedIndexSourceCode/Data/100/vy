  <row Id="7019031" PostId="6062593" Score="1" Text="Sounds like you can modify `foo1`, but not its signature (because it has to be called through the function pointer by `bar`, and you can't change `bar`). Is that correct? If so, then you should probably define a function `foo` with an extra parameter, then have `foo1` call it with `CONST_VALUE_1` and `foo2` call it with `CONST_VALUE_2`. That's pretty much the best you can do without some form of closures or partial function application, which C lacks." CreationDate="2011-05-19T18:14:59.447" UserId="13005" />
