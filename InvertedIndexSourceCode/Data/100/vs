From this it is clear that `ptrdiff_t` is *not* guaranteed to be large enough to contain any offset in an object. It is also false that `ptrdiff_t` is &quot;the integer operand&quot; in pointer arithmetic. Any integral type can be used for pointer addition, the standard only makes `ptrdiff_t` a special case for subtraction. `size_t` is the type defined to be usable for any positive offset in an object, not `ptrdiff_t`. It doesn't &quot;happen&quot; to work, it's defined to. `offsetof` uses it too" CreationDate="2011-05-14T22:19:46.043" UserId="13005" />

I'm using the cocos2d-iphone engine, and the CADisplayLink callback was being called 60 times a second when NSRunLoop is in kCFRunLoopDefaultMode, but when you start moving the scrollview and the mode changes to UITrackingRunLoopMode, the callback was being called more often (I got around 90 fps). So many OpenGL calls were disrupting the UIScrollView, as you found out.

So it is not allowed to use the low 64KB address space to store. Right? Just trying to reason why the function is designed or behaves this way."
