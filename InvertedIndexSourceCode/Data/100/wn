However, there is one rule I always keep: I only optimize when there is a problem. In all other cases I write the most readable code. Using `join` seems like premature optimization to me. If you use a O/RM that screws up, it’s not a very good O/RM. It's hard for me to imagine that there is anyone who finds `join` more readable than the 'dotted' approach, but you're right, it's hard to argue about taste."

In the OP's case, the value of `foo` will be set to the current value of `Messages.SelectedItem` each time the method executes. In your answer's code, the value of `foo` is fixed as the value of `Messages.SelectedItem` at the time the constructor is called. Yet you say the value will be the one that is present &quot;at the moment this callback executes&quot;, which implies otherwise." CreationDate="2011-05-30T20:51:33.040" UserId="137624" />

It looks like you compiled the binary on another system against that system's newer glibc, and then tried to run it on a Gentoo box that has a lesser version of glibc.

You're still stuck with a 2-channel analog interface &amp; so the bits in the file have to be converted to 'modem tones' in the iPhone and demodulated in the PC.  The analog channels have a greater bandwidth than phone lines &amp; so you should be able to do better than the old '56k' modems, but that's the only way it can be done.
