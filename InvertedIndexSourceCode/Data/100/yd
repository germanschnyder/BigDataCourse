You're right, I've stopped investing time in this eclipse plugin as the springsource sts guys start working on a plugin. the sts 2.7.2 has pretty nice gradle support. the functionality of my plugin is completely available in the sts plugin. but the functionality of the sts gradle plugin goes far beyond. Actually I am joining forces with them to get better Editor support for gradle files. This editor support is based on the new DSLD feature of the groovy-eclipse plugin."

I am curious how well the reaction performs with these two ways. The pattern I used is definitely worse with many, many elements.  But with 30? when focus and blur are run 30 times?

If you do include a `limit`, the query will probably be faster, which was the point I was trying to make by posting the link. I'm quite sure that PDO::fetch doesn't affect the query itself, but only the already fetched resource. Having said that, it's most likely that the limit is necessary for an optimized operation. Ok?"

The translate and scale steps are unnecessary and wrong given that you then compute the transformed co-ordinates yourself, so they are doubly-transformed: Your drawing, if you were to actually draw, would be in the wrong place and too big. Also, `CGContextAddRect` will not give you rounded-corner anything. Throw out `AddRect`, translate, and scale; draw the path in a CGPath object, *then* gsave, add the path, set the shadow, and stroke, then grestore, re-add the path, clip, and draw the image."
