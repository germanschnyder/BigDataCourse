The whole problem is because when trying to establish connection via SSH (&gt;git push origin master), git was trying to use PUTTY, and when &gt;ssh git@github.com it uses ssh client that goes with git install package. So to me the following helped: I reinstalled git, and when the wizard asked what ssh client to use, I checked OpenSSH this time! So, putty appeared the root of all evil. Good luck to everyone."

The JAR could be placed under `WEB-INF/lib` as part of the build process, which would also work, and which makes the compiled WAR file more portable.  Typically the Tomcat directories are uses for JAR files that are needed by multiple webapps running on the same server, which doesn't appear to be applicable here.
