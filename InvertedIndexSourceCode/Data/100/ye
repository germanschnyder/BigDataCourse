Then, to answer your question, you are right that to calculate a distance, you need two points. And you've got these: `p` (an argument to the `Distance…` method), and `center` (a field of your `Circle` class). But of course you need to initialize `center`, e.g. by passing the center point to `Circle`'s constructor: `class Circle { … public Circle(Point center, double radius) { this.center = center; this.radius = radius; } …`" CreationDate="2011-06-30T13:26:36.233" UserId="240733" />

Also, looking at their API, I don't see an &quot;addEvent&quot; defined for a froogaloop object, just an addEventListener.  They define their own addEvent in their example code that wraps addEventListener.  Makes me think that there's a problem with using built-in addEvent related to Same Origin."

If, in your rule, you have no network access and no disk access, and no non-trivial loops, then I would say yes. If you're accessing the rule server requires a network call, than obviously this will have a huge impact. Usually you would have many rulse, each taking a very small time. There's really no magic here, it's just a code generator. How long would the rule take if you had hand-coded it? would be a good question to ask yourself."

I decided to just display a message saying they need to select a column from table C if they want to query using that date filter function." CreationDate="2011-06-30T21:43:12.600" UserId="823194" />
