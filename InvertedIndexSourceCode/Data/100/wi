The LINQ to Entities provider translates expression trees to SQL. But there are expression trees that it can't translate. Not everything you can write in code can be translated to SQL. That's what the exception is telling you. It's failing at the translation to sql step not the translation to expression tree step. In this case it isn't smart enough to dig into `userSelector` and figure out what to do with it.

It is pretty handy if you don’t know the width of the element that’s floated, but in general, I think you would, and setting a margin with an explicit width (like you suggested I think) makes the CSS a bit more self-explanatory IMHO. This works in most browsers; in IE 6 you can achieve the same behaviour with `zoom: 1` and a margin fix.

Basically, once you have the direction of the line `d`, all points on the line are given by `p1 + ad`, where `a` is some scalar, `p1` is the point you know.  The point plus any amount of scaling of the direction.  All you need to do is find the value for a, where it hits the plane.  You can calculate that with the formula `a = ((zp - p1).n) / (d.n)`; where `zp` is any point in the plane (use `[0, 0, z]` for simplicity) and `n` is the normal to the z-plane (`[0, 0, 1]`)."
