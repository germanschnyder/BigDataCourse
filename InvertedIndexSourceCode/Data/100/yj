Wouldn't it be possible to work around this issue by the following: Instead of using `InheritedExport` on `IMetric` you could use only the `MetricAttribute` as you anyway have to declare it on your deriving types. At `MetricAttribute` ctor you could call `base(typeof(IMetric))`. You haven't provided further information on the `MetricAttribute` implementation, maybe you're already doing this there."
