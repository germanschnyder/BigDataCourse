The C/C++ standard does not allow functions with the same name but different return types. So if the function is called `void something()` you can't just call it `int something()` since the linker doesn't know what you want from it. The calling convention is another story. That is about how the parameters are passed on the stack to the function. `cdecl` specifies the standard c way instead of `fastcall` (or some others that exist)."
