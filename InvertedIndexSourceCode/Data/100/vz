When you change the contents of that `Grid` object, both cells will appear to change. Since your `Grid` object only contains a public integer field, I suggest changing the `grid` declaration and initialisation to `private int grid[][] = new int[dimx][dimy];`, so the assignment semantics will be what you need (scalar copy instead of reference copy)."

The php approach makes it much easier to integrate with dynamic login systems, for example, and it requires no knowledge of or access to apache configurations. On the other hand, it introduces some latency and server load and won't handle very large files well. The apache configuration approach is more efficient on the server, but doesn't give you as much flexibility to integrate with more robust php/mysql access systems, and it's just not an option for some.

I've found one small issue, however: if your resource URL has spaces in it, they get urlencoded (i.e. you end up with `%20` in your path).
