See RFC 4395 http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4395 A lot of software ignores this process, but it cites very practical reasons not to register new schemes, including: &quot;URI schemes constitute a single, global namespace; it is desirable to avoid contention over use of short, mnemonic scheme names.  For these reasons, the unbounded registration of new schemes is harmful.  New URI schemes SHOULD have clear utility to the broad Internet community, beyond that available with already registered URI schemes.&quot; Be a good citizen and don't make up new URI schemes for your mobile app. :)" CreationDate="2011-05-22T16:09:22.967" UserId="342605" />

Lets recode your sorting rows solution with a 1D array (don't even allocate it as `matrix[MAX][MAX]`, use `matrix[MAX*MAX]` instead).  As you originally did, pass the full matrix into `Qsort` (now declared `Qsort(int v[]...`), and pass `i*MAX` for `li` and `i*MAX+size-1` for `ls`.  Once that is working you could change it to `i` for `li` and `i+size-1` for `ls`.  Now in `order` instead of `++` or `--` use `+= MAX` and `-=MAX` to move by a row each time.  Hope that helps!"
