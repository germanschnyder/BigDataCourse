Lets recode your sorting rows solution with a 1D array (don't even allocate it as `matrix[MAX][MAX]`, use `matrix[MAX*MAX]` instead).  As you originally did, pass the full matrix into `Qsort` (now declared `Qsort(int v[]...`), and pass `i*MAX` for `li` and `i*MAX+size-1` for `ls`.  Once that is working you could change it to `i` for `li` and `i+size-1` for `ls`.  Now in `order` instead of `++` or `--` use `+= MAX` and `-=MAX` to move by a row each time.  Hope that helps!"
