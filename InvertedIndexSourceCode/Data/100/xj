When you load jQuery, it creates an object storing all its functions and data, and sets `window.jQuery` and `window.$` to it. When the scripts are loaded in the order you recommend, jQuery 1.6 overwrites all references to 1.4 (except in plugins, which keep their own copy); the only real function of the `noConflict` call is to save the 1.4 module to a variable. You could just as well write `var $mc = $` instead. Calling `noConflict` with or without `true` makes no difference whatsoever." CreationDate="2011-06-16T07:16:53.910" UserId="323407" />
