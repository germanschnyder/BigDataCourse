An obvious one is that this regex won't match `&lt;img style=&quot;...&quot; src=&quot;...&quot;/&gt;`, because it requires the `src` to be next to the `img`."

Once it is a list it has an order (the order it was returned in), you are never guaranteed what order the keys and values will come back in, but lists guarantee order of their elements, so `(a =&gt; 1, %h)` creates a list that starts with `&quot;a&quot;`, followed by `1`, followed by the first key returned by `%h`, followed by the first value returned by `%h`, and so on. That list is then assigned to the target hash in the list order, which means if the key `&quot;a&quot;` is in `%h` then it will override the original."

Also, if you want the (max - min) in a group to be less than N, that's a little different from what I'm doing... in mine, only adjacent numbers have to be less than N to be in a group. You can easily tweak mine to do it the other way, though. As for MATLAB syntax... somebody else will need to help you there." CreationDate="2011-07-22T18:35:03.863" UserId="847269" />
