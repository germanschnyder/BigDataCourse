If you want to allow forms to send data back to the server, you'll probably need to use hidden fields anyway.

Do you want a `Renderer` to emit the tree as HTML or parse data in JS and recreate on page load? You are going to have to write the JavaScript to a greater or lesser extent anyway."

Like other comments here mention, late versions of MSVC support some uses of volatile variables by promising not to move other accesses across a volatile access. Other compilers do not promise that. Some hardware will sync the caches of separate CPUs. Others will not unless explicitly asked to, as it is expensive. In that case each CPU can have it's own cached copy of the variable for a very long time. Using a lock makes **sure** that it works. Otherwise it is a system specific and non-portable solution."
