In practices though, hashing can be faster for small (or even fairly large) values of N, even if it comes at the price of linear polling in the case of collisions. As I said in the post the difference between an array of N=1 and N=1,000,000 is only 2x slower, so the hashing function is obviously large enough to eat of most of the time in most cases. **But to answer your first question**, PHP hash lookups are technically O(n), you'll even see it though, because you'll run out of ram first."
