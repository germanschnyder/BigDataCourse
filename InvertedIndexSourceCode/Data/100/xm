I imported the dump using 'imp' using oracle for windows.  in my tables, there are some text fields with linefeeds (created in oracle for linux) but when I imp into oracle for windows those records are dropped.  What I can do on the other hand is create a .csv file of a table and replace all \n with \r\n for the fields that contain line feeds, then I can do a sqlldr in windows and the data are all in.
