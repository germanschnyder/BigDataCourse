If you are working on x86 and your Linux kernel is 2.6.31 or newer, you may find a more lightweight KEDR system (http://kedr.berlios.de/) useful to check your modules for memory leaks. Unlike built in kernel facilities like Kmemleak, KEDR does not require rebuild of the kernel. It should be quite easy to set up and use." CreationDate="2011-05-27T14:01:27.953" UserId="689077" />

If variables are meant to be 'fully' accessible for subclasses then you should have direct access to them, they should be protected no need for methods. But then if you are making an API or you are not completely certain of the class design, thus in order to protect your code from future changes, doing as you are saying would be the best option. There is lots of issues involved here, for example, 'faster' direct access versus code modifiability. In the end it all depends on what is the use of the parent class, I suppose."
