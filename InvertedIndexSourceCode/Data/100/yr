Can you pull data from a slave server and put the needed bits into your transactional queries on the Master so you involve fewer tables in those queries?"

Yes it does matter if the messages are lost, but I think I've solved that problem at the source. I.e In my example the sensor data comes from a record in data logger that has already been saved in a FIFO. If the record isn't delivered then it won't be deleted from the FIFO and resent later. At this stage I don't think ordering is important as the payload will have a 'record created' datestamp.

Now you can limit the fields you return, but the server still has to load the entire `map` document into memory. At best you can save some bandwidth by transferring only the needed tiles. If you look at your structure, you have an array of objects. You cannot limit fields this way. With my version you can do `db.coll.find({_id:'map1'},{'tiles.0_1':1})` and return only that one tile. If `row`+`col` is unique, you can model it that way. Also it looks like the `terrain` object is heavily repeated, is this necessary?" CreationDate="2011-07-11T07:32:38.770" UserId="261188" />

If you pick wrong (say you were passing in a tuple of positional values and want to add a keyword value), you have to re-write the whole thing. With `format`, you can pass in any combination of arguments that any other function would accept. I'm sure someone will also come up with a use case where having `format` as a first-class function is handy." CreationDate="2011-07-11T15:41:04.533" UserId="32538" />
