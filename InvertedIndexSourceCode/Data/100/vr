I read Draft standard N3242 (Feb 2011) §14.6.4.1/1, Point of Instantiation is after the scope of the first use, just as described in Stroustrup (2000) but by §3.4.2, if “int” is the argument type, instantiation context for dependent names in f&lt;int&gt; contains nothing that was not visible at the definition. So to make Stroustrup’s point today, you must specialize f&lt;T&gt; and g(T) on some class, not a primitive type, to bring in T’s enclosing namespace. One less barrier to JIT instantiation, FWIW. http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2011/n3242.pdf for those following." CreationDate="2011-05-13T20:44:21.793" UserId="55946" />

Honestly I still think that you code is confusing because the code has just advantage of not declaring the extern again and again in every source file wishing to use the global object else where declared. If the `extern` goes in the beginning of the source file, then it is easy to think that it is declared else where. At least, I practice the way what @Als used when I am forced to use global variables. I am just seeing your comment. Let me read it first." CreationDate="2011-05-14T10:42:11.717" UserId="528724" />
