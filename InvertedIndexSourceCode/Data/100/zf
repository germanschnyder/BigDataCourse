You can send the data over it as binary, do partial transfers, do parallel transfers, etc. Moreover, the overhead of the inline header is pretty small with a large transfer; FTP and SSH (scp, sftp) have similar levels of cost. For small transfers, being able to share connections between transfers (a “persistent” connection) is a big win; with pipelining and a few other things, it makes HTTP one of the _more_ efficient protocols. Writing a client that is able to take advantage of all of these things is hard though." CreationDate="2011-07-20T22:32:43.797" UserId="301832" />
