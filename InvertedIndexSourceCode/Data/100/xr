If I delete an object, I want it to not show up in my app. For example, I have a table of objects. The user deletes an object from the table and I send a &quot;deleteObject:&quot; message to my context to delete that object. I would expect that object to not appear in the table. I could manually check for the isDeleted attribute, but this is very tedious and also extremely error prone. To make things worse, this behaviour seems to be inconsistent.
