The `PerformClick` method was included specifically for this reason, because it's not a good idea to call event handler methods directly. You made a claim you can't defend."

Even when you use the best available idioms, it is not expressive enough for my taste. Sure, if you are given a large existing codebase, refactoring is one of the best things you can do, but I wouldn't start a new project in Java (given excellent JVM alternatives such as Scala or Clojure). Regarding generic code, I think languages without support for closures, higher order functions, etc, do not encourage it, and generics is too weak of a substitute."
