The difference lies in whether you create a stack of nested tags at the beginning, or at the end. I feel the latter is easier for myself." CreationDate="2011-06-10T08:13:08.607" UserId="314166" />

Thankfully, when Ruby (v. 1.9.2, at least) interpolates the sub-regex, it also wraps the sub-regex in parenthesis like so `(?-mix:...)`, so alternation works as expected."
