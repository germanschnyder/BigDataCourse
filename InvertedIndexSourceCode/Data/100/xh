You would of course need to make sure that `setRowId()` is always called before any of the `get` methods. `Provider` is for dynamically retrieving instances of types that are bound in the `Injector`.

My guess is that global rules (definitions) may undergo some internal optimizations at the time the definition is made, which require the value of `Default` at definition-time.
