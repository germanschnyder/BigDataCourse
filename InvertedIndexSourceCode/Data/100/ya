There is a code that depends on a and b--the function calling `f` that was not written yet, but which the compiler has to cater for. It can't assume that the called function does not have reference to a and b either, because it's a library function it does not see. Linker possibly could (if it wasn't using shared libraries, which it usually will) and could rearrange the operations, but knows better than to do so across a system call (because otherwise half of threaded programs out there would stop working)."
