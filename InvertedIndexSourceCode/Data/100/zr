The reader thread will therefore get an enumerator that points to list1 and it will begin iterating over list1. If at some point a writer copies list1, then makes a new list2, and sets variable x to list2, this has no affect on the currently iterating reader thread.

Standard doesn't dictate The very raison d'être of `intptr_t` type is the fact that pointer size might be not connected with any of other types, thus storing it in 'normal' integer variable is impossible. Cf. in (theoretic) C99 compiler for x86 real mode `intptr_t` would be 32bit (to store `far ptr`), but `size_t` would be 16bit, because contiguous memory area size is limited to one segment."
