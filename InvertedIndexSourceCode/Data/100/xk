The only reason to do that in Mathematica is when we know the upper bounds for the size and are ready to trade memory for speed (given the nature of mma performance-tuning). Generally, when the size is not known in advance, the solution is to *not* allocate huge memory but to construct a list dynamically. In a lower level language like C one would likely use linked lists for that. Linked lists may also be used in Mathematica, but `Reap`-`Sow` approach is superior."

The latter must be stored to the database in onPause because it's the only guarantied call. If you put it in onSaveInstanceState instead, you risk loosing data if that is not called.
