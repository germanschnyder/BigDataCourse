Using explicit locations means that you have the same locations application-wide (could use an enum to identify each one) and different shaders with different inputs can use the same VAO. Which means you save binding a different VAO when switching shaders. This is less work and less state changes. Somewhat similarly, uniform blocks+UBOs could make your life easier. In principle, you could have a struct that has the same layout as your uniform block and do a binary copy into the buffer object (instead of figuring out each one)."

But the problem is error recovery; if the server ever encounters an error sending a message on the callback channel, it closes the channel. Depending on the cause, the client may or may not get notified, and if it doesn't, it thinks it's still connected, but nothing will ever come back from the server. So then what, you implement a Ping() back &amp; forth just to make sure both ends are still connected? Now you're basically back to polling, albeit (probably) less frequently."

  <row Id="6357106" PostId="5531226" Score="0" Text="@bbum I don't disagree with you there. I'm just arguing, from a defensive programming point of view, that it doesn't hurt to initialize `error` to _nil_ in case the method returns an error value but fails to set the `error` object. I've run into this with third-party frameworks. You can argue that you should leave it uninitialized to catch these sorts of errors during development, much like the _nil_ in `dealloc` debate, but I'm talking about improving the quality of shipping code for your customers."
