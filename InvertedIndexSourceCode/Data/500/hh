Creating an object first allocates a large enough block of memory and pass a pointer into it to the most derived type constructor. Note that while in the first case `this` is a pointer into the beginning of the allocated memory block, whenever there is multiple inheritance, `this` may not be a pointer to the beginning of the allocated memory: `struct b1 { int x; b1(); }; struct b2 { int x; b2(); }; struct d : b1, b2 {}` the `this` pointer passed to the `b1` and `b2` constructors differ."

Having RTTI for methods on classes opens up remoting, automation, dynamic binding etc. but methods on records are less useful and have drawbacks, like the risk of operating on a copy of the record, rather than the original.
