The simple fact of the matter is, circumventing either MD5 or SHA1 is well within the realm of possibility these days, and the odds only get better for the attacker. Even salted, the attacks are truncated collision attacks, meaning salt+SHA1 is effectively useless (taking the birthday paradox into account.) If you want stable, long-term security, don't use either MD5 or SHA1. Use SHA256 or better." CreationDate="2010-02-25T02:21:23.253" UserId="111554" />
