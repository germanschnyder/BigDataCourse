When the compiler needs to write warnings or errors, it will write them to stderr. When the compiler front-end outputs intermediate code for the assembler, it might write the intermediate code on stdout and the assembler might accept its input on stdin, but all that would be behind the scenes from your perspective as a user.) Once you have a compiled program, that program can write errors to its standard error as well, but it has nothing to do with being compiled."

The 'root view' can't cover the tabbar itself. (if it did you'd never be able to uncover the tabbar.)
