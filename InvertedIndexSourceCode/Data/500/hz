After much trying I concluded that the only way to return json data from my webservice was to set the contentType to 'application/json' as stated. I decided against this approach because I didn't want to go down the path of serializing a simple form as json just for the sake of posting it especially since any functionality to do this is not supported by default in all browsers. In the end I decided that the best approach is to use ASP.NET MVC, which provides 'out of the box' json support via the JSONResult in the Controller.

However, it's the same problem even if `S` isn't divisible by 3. For instance, say you want to find a 3-tuple for S = 11 in [1, 2, 4, 5]. That's the same as finding which numbers sum to zero in [(1 - 11/3), (2 - 11/3), (4 - 11/3), (5 - 11/3)]. The algorithm only cares that numbers can be summed; it doesn't actually care that they're integers." CreationDate="2010-04-21T08:42:02.513" UserId="75170" />
