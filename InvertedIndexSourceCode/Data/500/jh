In the example you have given, you are using an array as well - an array of objects -  `[{tip_1, 4}, {tip_2, 2}, {tip_4, 2}, {tip_3, 1}]`. You can write a custom sort method that takes in the hash, and returns an *array* of sorted objects, but that sorted array will not be the same as your original Hash, which basically means you have two separate representations of your data.

Turns out I didn't read the documentation carefully enough; I thought `drange` returned an array of `date` objects but it actually returns floats which need to be converted using `num2date`."

The magic number &quot;3&quot; is not a sensible business &quot;rule&quot;.  It's just a random magic number.  It can't be significant; it will change randomly through the life of the project.  It is the absolute worst kind of business rule in all layers of the architecture, and particularly costly and complex in the database for absolutely no value."
