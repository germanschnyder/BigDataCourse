As Va and Vm get close, any calculations will blow up, this is because if north is straight down then you can't find a horizontal north direction. now if the 2 vectors stay arbitrarily far apart, then your result will move smoothly with the vectors, and won't &quot;suddenly&quot; flip (so think of your /|\ as a rotation around Vm instead of a move through it). If you rotate your device 180˚ about Vm then north _should_ end up on the other side of the device.

Wouldn't it make more sense to have a table for all student skills and then an n:m table linking the students with the skills (columns *id*, *name*) and a value corresponding to the checkbox (columns *student_id*, *skill_id*, [boolean] *has_skill*) ? Or alternatively, you could use an INT column with a bit mask of skills (first bit = HTML, second = CSS etc.).
