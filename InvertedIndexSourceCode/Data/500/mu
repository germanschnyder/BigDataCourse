The Service talks to the Repository, where an instance is injected into the Service Layer ctor by DI (StructureMap). And yes - the repositories are implemented with generics. There is a root interface called `IRepository&lt;T&gt;` which defines Add, Find, Remove, etc. Then in my DI, i say &quot;If someone requests `IRepository&lt;Person&gt;`, give them `GenericRepository&lt;Person&gt;`. THis is another generic class implementing the interface. Cool huh?" CreationDate="2010-10-14T21:18:06.980" UserId="321946" />

Keep these DB's seperate from your regular data. Also, you might not even need replication, if the web sites are on the same box (ours were not, so we did need replication).

When thinking about pre-increment as first incrementing and then producing a reference to x, how could this produce anything but x set to 42? Yet it is formally UB in C++98, since it modifies x twice between sequence points. It has to do with allowing the compiler to *assume* that there will at most be one change of x, and that x will not be both modified and used, so it can do things in registers and not worry about the final value, which (&quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot;) it can just store to mem at the very end of the full-expression."
