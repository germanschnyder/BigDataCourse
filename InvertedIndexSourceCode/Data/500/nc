IMHO, this is very similar; it's about the compiler being allowed to make assumptions about aliases.  The standard allows it to assume that `links` can only be used to access `links[0]` to `links[3]`.  If you use it to access `links[-1]`, then you have *absolutely* no guarantee that this won't break if you increase the optimisation setting, where the compiler aggressively reorders accesses to variables.

There's really nothing more to it.  The &quot;double references&quot; issue you bring up is a red herring; C++0x allows for reference collapsing which resolves that issue but still you cannot have a container of references because references are neither objects nor assignable."

All other sizes are in multiples of one byte, so in a 16 bit byte system, a 32 bit value has a sizeof 2 and therefore sizeof(char*) would be 2 if it was a 32 bit value. sizeof returns the number of addressable units required to store the value."
