Although if you have a separate button that adds new boxes, I would probably say it's better to add the first one with JS, that way it keeps all the box code in one place, and if you make a change, you don't need to remember to do it both in the JS and in the static HTML" CreationDate="2011-03-28T12:27:40.850" UserId="448296" />

What puzzles me is this: Do I have to duplicate all the parameters of the appender, such as `rollingStyle` and `maximumFileSize`? It sounds really stupid to write them twice, because a file cannot have a maximum size of 100KB and 200KB at the same time. And what will happen if in the future someone tries to change one of the parameters without knowing that they are duplicated between the two appenders? Is this issue solvable?"

I started a new Excel 2007 spreadsheet, typed in some numbers in a column, and then duplicated the column. I changed column A to Arial (and left column B in Calibri). I conditionally formatted the cells in column A to underline the cell if it equaled 10. Excel underlined one cell *and left it in Arial*. Is that the behavior you are seeing? If not -- that is if your conditional change causes a change to Calibri -- then you might want to report your bug to http://answers.microsoft.com or http://groups.google.com/group/microsoft-office-2007 ."

The most obvious benefit is removing the necessity of having to manually construct objects throughout your code base or maintain factories (or factory methods).
