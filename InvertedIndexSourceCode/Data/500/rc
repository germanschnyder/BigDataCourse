I'd suggest this over magic numbers because there's always a risk with a magic number that someone will store data that also starts with the magic number, which will trick your program into deallocating a non-list as a list.

If that is the case, is there a way to call like `event.preventDefault()` to pause the click and then somehow continue it after `def.done()` is done?"
