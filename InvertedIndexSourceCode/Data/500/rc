I'd suggest this over magic numbers because there's always a risk with a magic number that someone will store data that also starts with the magic number, which will trick your program into deallocating a non-list as a list.

I'll try that out but I have a question... would your example with the Deferred object pause the `.click()` event handler and continue after the `def.done()` finishes or would it just go through the whole click event? If that is the case, is there a way to call like `event.preventDefault()` to pause the click and then somehow continue it after `def.done()` is done?"
