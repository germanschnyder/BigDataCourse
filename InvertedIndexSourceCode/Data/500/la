In this example you might have a 'DvdFinder' class which would have methods like 'ById', 'ByTitle', 'ByActor', etc. The `VISITOR` pattern might help you out in the cases were you need multiple criterion. Again, the join and group by's are going to be the hardest part of your implementation. The simpilest approach to that might be to create the functions one-by-one without generics to start.
