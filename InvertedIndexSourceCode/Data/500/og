If your view has a form that does an HTTP POST to the server, all of the inputs will go into the POST message and be processed by the MVC model binder. This modelbinder looks @ the field names and maps them to the object in your post method. So, to pass things between the Get/Post methods you can store them in hidden fields in the form or use session. HTH, T.J.
