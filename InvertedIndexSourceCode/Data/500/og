If your view has a form that does an HTTP POST to the server, all of the inputs will go into the POST message and be processed by the MVC model binder. This modelbinder looks @ the field names and maps them to the object in your post method. So, to pass things between the Get/Post methods you can store them in hidden fields in the form or use session. HTH, T.J.

As I already answered, yes, you can use other databases. Also, as Mike pointed out, it would not be &quot;WAMP&quot;, as that assumes use of a MySQL database, but Oracle and other databases can be used in place of MySQL, assuming you have the PHP extension installed allowing you to access that particular database."

I think highend CPU has separate caches per core, but for uniform memory architectures, it seems that you need a globally coherent TLB, right ? Do high end hardware suffer from similar issues ?"
