Unless your job needs to run in real-time, it should be okay to skip an execution once in a while and let it catch-up the next time around.

Of course, this strategy depends on the expected time of execution being less than the schedule interval as you say...otherwise things will pile up!

If it's the actual type, then `dynamic_cast` succeeds after just one comparison. Otherwise, it fails after two comparisons, because there is only one base. If the hierarchy is much more complicated, then the optimization isn't difficult, but this should be plenty fast." CreationDate="2011-04-14T13:38:39.113" UserId="153285" />

You have several options. You have an encrypted license file in your 'main' software which determines features. The license generator, which you want to keep secure, you could implement as either web service which needs a login or perhaps a program on a USB key which requires a password. But with a daily changing password your engineers will still need contact with 'home'. So why not put your license tool online? It cannot be left behind then."

Next run the `c` will be 1, `r` will be 12 - everything still fine. But in the third loop `c` will be 12 and `r` is now -128 (due to the overflow happening) - the if statement will be true."
