I added the code necessary to pass the error on and it is working! &#xA;&#xA;As for your second answer, even though my VR can access the error, the dg is still looking to the IDEI in the model for its message and validation result? How can I get the rule to override the IDEI in this case? I am trying to get the VR to clear the validation error in the dg when the error is fixed, but I can only do it if I sort or refresh the dg. I thought having the VR set the result to ValidResult would clear the error. BTW, Thanks!" CreationDate="2010-07-29T13:58:35.747" UserId="296848" />
