But the purpose of MooTools is different from the purpose of jQuery, I believe. jQuery simplifies working on DOM, attaches features to DOM elements etc. and MooTools just completely changes the way the JavaScript code is being written. I personally prefer MooTools to write complicated code (it makes the code clean and very maintainable), but jQuery has strong advantages (many available plugins and simplicity to accomplish simple things). Finding a way to use them both in some effective way would be fantastic. But I believe it is not that easy at the moment." CreationDate="2011-05-12T16:24:08.627" UserId="548696" />

First, the regex motor finds a match of ``[\w\.]`` with ``'foo.txt_'`` , then it verifies that it is followed by a character ``'_'``; since it isn't true, it comes back and tries if ``[\w\.]`` matches with the string less the last character, that is to say with ``'foo.txt'`` : this time it's right, because it is really followed by a character ``'_'``. But it's a weird process. I think it is better to put a ``'?'`` in the pattern to cut the greediness of the regex." CreationDate="2011-05-12T19:28:28.993" UserId="551449" />

I ended up using the Eigen matrix library which noticably decreased the runtime of my progam. I did do profiling (using the Visual C++ Profiler and AMD CodeAnalyst) before asking this question and it reported  zzz_AsmCodeRange_begin (I googled this but I still have no idea what it means) as doing the most individual work, followed by one of my methods (which is the one I eventually optimized using matrices).
