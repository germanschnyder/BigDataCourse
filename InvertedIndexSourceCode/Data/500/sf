Windows uses a mixture of calling conventions in its APIs e.g. `__cdecl` C-style (caller cleans arguments from stack), `__stdcall` Pascal-style (callee cleans), `__fastcall` some regs `__thiscall` C++ ecx=this etc. Linux generally doesn't - everyone uses cdecl which is actually default. So I'd suggest you just #define ESCALLBACK and ESUTIL_API to nothing, or delete them throughout. The exact GCC equivalent would be `__attribute__((cdecl))` but that's the default calling convention so it's easier to just omit it." CreationDate="2011-03-07T12:14:09.003" UserId="243245" />

It is possible, in theory, to parallelise automatically even an imperative code, so it is ok to ask if a compiler can do that already.
