So I'd suggest: check if id present, if so, append this id to the #box-anchors, if not, create own id, append this to #box-anchors, and add this id to the h1. That way you won't disturb the structure of the html and are more certain all other js and css will keep working. (for instance: what if the h1 is the first child of the div, and some script uses that property? or what if a css rule or js selector uses the next-sibling of the h1?)"

Hack in an extra first item to your adapter that is the &quot;no selection&quot; item, and detect when the user switches off from it. 2). Your client adapts to the behavior of `Spinner` and stops expecting users to always make a positive selection. 3). You use something else for your UI (e.g., `singleChoice` `ListView`) which supports the notion of there being no selection.

If you have policies that prevent you from just committing (and you can't change them) then the advanced solution is to use Mercurial Queues with a patch repository (`hg qinit -c `) and commit _that_ often.
