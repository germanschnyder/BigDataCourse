In contrast, Java/C# bytecode is JITted to native code, which then executes - there's no interpreter there (well, it's a bit more complex when Java is involved, but the end result is the same). The difference in performance because of this technique can easily reach 20x in favor of JIT (read the early UnrealScript papers by Tim Sweeney, he explores it there)."
