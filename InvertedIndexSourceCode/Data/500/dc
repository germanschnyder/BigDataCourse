You could supply your own, but before 3.5 it was a pain.  But since 3.5 they added the lambda version where you can define equality as necessary.  I said LINQ because it was the first thing I thought of that matched his request, but I think you're right, if you already have a List, you should use the built in operators.

But the `ToString` implementation of your enum uses Flags, and so does `Enum.IsDefined`, `Enum.Parse`, etc. Try to remove Flags and look at the result of MyColor.Yellow | MyColor.Red; without it you get &quot;5&quot;, with Flags you get &quot;Yellow, Red&quot;. Some other parts of the framework also use [Flags] (e.g., XML Serialization)." CreationDate="2009-08-17T17:30:32.837" UserId="143854" />
