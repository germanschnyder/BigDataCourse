The `%hx` has no meaning to the compiler- all the compiler cares about is the upconversion from `short` to `signed int` in the variadic parameter. So it may do a sign-extend that you don't want. Of course, this only applies if you passed a signed short and then tried to use it as though it were unsigned. Given how much abuse `printf` has been put to through the years, this is not an implausible case. `%hx` shouldn't do anything when used strictly legally, but it seems safe to say that strict legality is unlikely."

You could type the argument/variable as `ICollection&lt;T&gt;`.  Doing so would prevent you from calling List specific methods such as AddRange which may not be available on other types (say `ObservableCollection&lt;T&gt;`) you may later want to pass into the algorithm."
