If I was indeed assigned the task of finding the cause of the AV in this code, which I am totally unacquainted with too, I would probably used this primitive device: I would store a unique symbolic value to a local string variable before each line potential of causing the error, and include the var's value in the error log, to quickly determine the offending line. (Maybe using some debugging tool would be more reasonable, but I'm not really familiar with those, so I'm offering the method that has helped me quite many times.)"

It adds all of the children and handles updates directly in AS3 as opposed to using MXML and skinning.  This is done for the purposes of efficiency.  You can always create a standard MXML ItemRenderer, but you will be giving up perf.  I've extended MobileItemRenderer before, though, so it can be done.  I actually recommend extending MobileItemRenderer because it is more simple to extend, and use the code from MobileIconItemRenderer as a guide."
