I'm pretty new to forming SQL queries at this advanced level, so I would have never thought of consecutively joining a table to itself, but can clearly see how this works.  My next challenge will be incorporating this into a larger query, but this gives me a great start.  Much thanks!  &#xA;&#xA;One question though, regarding:&#xA;&quot;Of course this will fall short should the maximum role_id increase...&quot;&#xA;Do you simply mean to say that if I were to add more role_ID's, I would need to account for them in the query, or are you suggesting more than that?"
