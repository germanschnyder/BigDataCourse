I guess I need to actually get some documentation for a CDN and figure out how we can make it work with our deployment process.  At the beginning we're going to be mapping an assets sub domain back to our web server and using that for CDN content.  This gives us a contingency plan for if the site needs to scale.  In this situation we would need to push data to it, perhaps using a shell script and rsync and in the deployment process we would have to scan css files etc. to map local directory assets e.g. /assets/images/img1.jpg to assets.mydomain.com/assets."
