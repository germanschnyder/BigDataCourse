In `foo.X = 3`, the `=` symbol is replaced by the *compiler* by a call to `foo.set_X(3)`. You can already define a `public static T op_Assign(ref T assigned, T assignee)` method.

A model could not be just a diagram because a diagram is for me just a view of the model in specific configuration and not the model itself. I have seen an interesting opposition between Ed (e.g. EMF) and Vlad (Omondo) because for Ed modeling is a view of a problem and for Vlad modeling cover full project.

So in little endian we would have a representation of `00010100 00000000`. Notice that in both cases, 2 bytes are required... and in your example, they WILL both start at address 2000.

Using the transitive reduction is better because the number of edges decreases (so the branching factor should also decrease so less useless nodes are examined). Since the graph is acyclic, there is going to be a set of nodes which have no edges that enter them, and you can start from there (these represent the sets which have no supersets in your collection). You'd have to start DFS on all of these (or just start from a virtual node connected to all these sets-with-no-supersets)." CreationDate="2010-12-28T10:03:27.263" UserId="288222" />
