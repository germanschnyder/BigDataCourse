Whenever an action (ie - CREATE) occurs, have a listener thread wait up to 1 second to see if another action is detected. If no action is detected, then perform the sync. Then once a sync is initiated postpone further calls to sync to until the current sync has been finished. If files are left to sync, perform another sync after the first one. This will force syncs into batches of small file groups. Or will sync one large file at a time. Which seems kind of reasonable." CreationDate="2010-09-09T01:32:45.033" UserId="110129" />

My concern is when a thread call write to a single file, when the other thread call to write to the same file as well...

If it is the case, how do I ensure that the second call to write would not wait and would return immediately if there is a first write as I don't want the write of second thread to wait" CreationDate="2010-09-09T06:47:17.870" UserId="443079" />

If access was not a developer tool then why does Access 2010 have Source code control baked into the product?  You think features like VSS source code control support is for non coders and end users?  Access is a tool that spans skills from non coders to that of disconnected recordsets and creating of browser neutral web sites on SharePoint, great ribbon development support, and even support for SQL Auzre (cloud sql) is built into the product. Hardly a non developers tool when you talk about web Forms, VSS and even Azure support." CreationDate="2010-09-09T13:49:14.590" UserId="10527" />
