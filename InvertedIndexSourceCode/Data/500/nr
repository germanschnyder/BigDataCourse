The exchange between `DateTime.Now` and `SystemTime.Now` could be done by the test system like you do static exchange of contracts in .Net contract based programming. However, there is a problem with both solutions. They could be dependent on other libraries and plugins which use `DateTime.Now` and then there will be a mismatch between dates so the semantic meaning is not equal to running on a system with its time changed."
