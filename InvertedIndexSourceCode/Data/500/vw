Therefore if you try to access it on the host as with `(void**)&amp;PNT` you are trying to read a device variable from the host which is not permitted.  From the host code point of view it's just a symbol, so you need to use `cudaGetSympolAddress()` to store the device address in a host variable that you can then pass to `cudaMemcpyToSymbol()`, as @talonmies shows."

I'm think i could just remove telerik paging, let it create all the rows for me and then hide and show to do paging myself. (can I manually control the telerik paging control?) Same for sorting, just have a function that takes in all the ids of the rows and sorts then on the col, and then returns the sorted list of ids, and then I just change the order... I think I can do this efficiently all client side? Although at that point whats the point of using the telerik grid?" CreationDate="2011-05-18T11:57:30.057" UserId="351980" />
