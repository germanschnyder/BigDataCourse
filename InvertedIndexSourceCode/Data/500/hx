The important thing to realize about singletons is that they are no different from global variables. That doesn't necessarily mean that they should be avoided in all cases, it just means that they have the same drawbacks, especially when it comes to proper encapsulation and ease of testing. In this case, for example, it becomes very difficult to test individual classes that depend on `[MyCommon singleton]` in isolation without first setting up the global `user` value."
