Once that's done, there's no going back. Properties are NOT fields because they provide you with a mechanism to intercept attempts to access fields (by routing them to methods if those are defined); that is, however, nothing more than syntax sugar over getter / setter methods. It's extremely convenient but it doesn't alter the underlying paradigm - exposing fields with no control over access to them violates the principle of encapsulation."
