If you pass the pointer in, there is no such dependency. So sure it's OK to have such dependency, but there may be other ways to solve such things.

You can define a placement form of `operator delete` but this does not destroy objects, it is called when it matches an `operator new` in a new expression and the object construction fails after the memory allocation succeeds to correctly deallocate the allocated raw memory. If a placement new expression succeeds then the correct way to destroy the object is with an explicit call to the destructor followed by a matching deallocation (if applicable)."
