Unfortunately the only way to change that, that I know of, is to recompile Python. See if the `--dry-run` switch will print out all the commands and you can remove `-arch ppc` and run them manually."

This will most likely force the integer to be be converted to a float64 before the addition can performed. Converting all the constants into float64 first will probably help. (2) IIRC, Python caches PyFloat objects so repeated deletion/creation is fast. Numpy probably don't cache deleted objects. (Haven't checked the source.)"
