Recently I noticed that the Linq `Any` method doesn't follow the same pattern as the `First` and `Count` methods; i.e. it does not check if the source implements ICollection in order to check if ICollection.Count &gt; 0. Instead it always uses IEnumerator.MoveNext() to see if the source is empty. I found that while performance is better doing the ICollection type check with List&lt;T&gt;, performance is much worse when source is an Array.
