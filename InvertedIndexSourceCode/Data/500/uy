I think windows is trying to get at the Open font instead of the TT Font for Arial resulting in the function being confused as to which to get. I've tried GetCharWidth32 and that seems to work, but the character widths returned are very small. Such as 4 or 8 pixels for a 25 point font. Either function seems to fail continually. Perhaps its because I'm using a GDIPlus font? Strange that it would take it in without errors then." CreationDate="2011-04-29T18:00:41.180" UserId="190184" />

You can get around that with `$(this).siblings().removeClass(&quot;hover&quot;)`.

The pointer to the UDT might require alignment to a 4-byte boundary, for example.  In that case, directly *casting* from 1-byte aligned char pointer to the UDT pointer will cause alignment and &quot;truncate&quot; the first 0 to 3 bytes of the structure.  Note that this is totally different the other way around (casting from `UDT*` to `char*`) because all 4-byte aligned pointers are also 1-byte aligned.  The posted code exhibits undefined behavior."
