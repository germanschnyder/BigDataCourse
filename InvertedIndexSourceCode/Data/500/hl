The functional characteristics of Scala are implemented _as_ object oriented features. Even the most functional Scala program will be composed solely of objects and its respectives classes and traits. Now, Martin Odersky may say whatever he wants about his language (it's _his_ language, after all), but, in a strictly technical evaluation, Scala is primarily object oriented, where by &quot;primarily&quot; I mean that everything else is built upon this characteristic."
