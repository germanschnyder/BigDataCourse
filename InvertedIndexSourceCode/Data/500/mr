The reason why I need one with objects and one with pointers is that in my real code I have a closed and an open list, keeping information about nodes that have been considered and the ones to consider, respectively. So, I first add a node to the open list, and, when it has been considered, remove it from the open list and place it in the closed list. So I added an other vector, called map, that keeps the node objects. The open and closed lists only keep pointers to objects within the map vector.

And the answer is that the CPUs typically set a series of several flags when an operation is performed, and the CPU can consult more than one of those flags to decide whether or not to branch. For example, when comparing i to 10, the compiler will typically do something like a subtract operation, which will set the carry flag if one operand is less than the other and will set the zero flag if the operands are equal.

However it seemed less intuitive to me than Soci, maybe it's just because I'm used to Soci. Another downside for me was the lack of native back-end to Sqlite, but going through ODBC for that instead. Kinda defeats the whole purpose of using Sqlite. And the corresponding example included a 'logon to db' call which makes little sense for Sqlite, but is still needed because of ODBC.
