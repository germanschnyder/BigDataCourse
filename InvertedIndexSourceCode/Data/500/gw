Then if the instructions edit memory (code), you don't do anything special, you just follow the instructions and they should do the right thing inside your big virtual memory array.

However, if you get into the habit of always specifying the literal first: 'if (5 = x)', the compiler can double-check your work and save you head banging time in the debugger.

Unfortunately Rapid Addition has not made their standard &quot;do not call&quot; list public, nor would I expect Microsoft to publicize such a list (especially since one would expect it to change over time as implementations of the listed methods become modified). Your best bet, as others have said, is to profile your code and find for yourself those places where unexpected levels of memory allocation may be occurring. In case you aren't already, I also strongly recommend using perfmon to monitor your GC count while debugging your app. It can be quite illuminating."

If you're worrying about escaping your cdata section because you're sending XHTML to as HTML to browsers that parse it as tagsoup, _you're doing it wrong_. If you're going to use XHTML, don't send it as text/html. If you're using HTML, don't put CDATA sections in it. Apart from that my advice still stands: keep your scripts out of your HTML if you want to make sure no browsers trip over it." CreationDate="2010-03-04T02:04:33.597" UserId="92048" />

I would add for the non-rubyists (and non-perl..ers?) that `or` is primarily used in situations like: `x = get_some_string or &quot;&quot;`. In this situation `get_some_string` could return nil or other 'falsy' value and x would become the empty string. Like Dmitriy says, though, `||` works perfectly well here too, it's just a convention you'll see occasionally in the ruby world (probably this is a carry-over from perl)."
