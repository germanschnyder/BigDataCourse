It's just too restrictive in the way it is implemented in Java. Maybe anchored exceptions would be a better choice, or maybe the Maybe and Either types from Haskell.

The tradeoff you get for compile-time type- and name-checking  (the anonymous delegate / lambda version) is that it takes twice as long, because the code calls a delegate which calls the property setter.
