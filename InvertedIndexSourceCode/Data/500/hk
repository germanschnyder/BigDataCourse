It's definitely a trade-off between performance (less memory pressure with a struct) and having a mutable struct which could introduce wierdness in the application.

If speed really is a concern (ie. you are expecting a large JSON string and need to perform well on really slow machines, or something similar) and you are the one controlling the JSON string, there's no reason to be afraid of using eval or the Function syntax Matt mentioned (if you are 100% sure that the JSON string will always be valid JSON and nothing malicious). However, it might (maybe) be harder to find syntax errors in the JSON using those methods." CreationDate="2010-03-26T13:24:15.113" UserId="48735" />
