The reason it might matter is that if you're in a 32 bit environment, then the byte codes for jcxz would be interpreted as jecxz. jecxz tests the whole of ECX, and you only initialised the lower 16 bits (CX). If you change it try to initialise ECX with the value of k instead of just CX it should produce an error if you are compiling for a 16-bit environment. If you're in a 32-bit environment it should work, and hopefully fix your problem. You should then also change jcxz to jecxz." CreationDate="2010-04-23T20:14:10.180" UserId="276403" />
