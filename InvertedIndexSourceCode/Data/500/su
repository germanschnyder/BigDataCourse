The more I read through you guys's suggestions, the more I come to the conclusion that no matter what values I bind to the query, the very same plan is re-used, exactly like in the article posted by EvilTeach. That article also mentions range predicates. In fact, removing the range predicate and replacing it by a simple `org.no = :B1` seems to provide an acceptable plan as well. However, since I'm using 11g and not 10g, I'll double-check and verify also ik_zelf's suggestions. There have been many feature additions in Oracle, since the 11g upgrade."
