Considering your algorithm is not a normal subset, it is the best approach, since you have to use a flagging algorithm. It is more like a matching algorithm, which are expensive. You can't design much more effective algorithm than the one provided (except the obvious minor stuff - like an `if` to check whether `indexes.Add` is necessary, etc.). You could compare performance between the algorithms using the `StopWatch` class. Btw. you should use `IsChildInMaster` first on all possibles and only then use `IsChildInMasterMulti`."
