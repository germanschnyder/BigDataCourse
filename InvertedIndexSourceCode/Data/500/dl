In our test, we would send the first bad request and then 10 good requests.  If session readonly was set, all the requests would be processed immediately even though we were writing to the session on the first request.  If the first request was not set to readonly, all the requests would wait until the timeout occurred on the first request (Since the first request had made it passed the session module locking the session, while not finishing because of not having the full request body)."
