If you wanted to simplify, you could make a convention stating: &quot;return the string 'error' when something goes wrong, else return the object&quot; and then you could just check for `if( item == 'error')` in your `success` block. You wouldn't get a strict server error, so it would be up to the client function to display the appropriate feedback to the user.
