The reason it's always 0 right now is, as @jonsca pointed out, because you never call `random.next()`." CreationDate="2011-04-15T04:02:29.057" UserId="56778" />

I agree with what you're suggesting I do, but I guess my grasp of variable assignment in JS is tenuous - I assumed that given the way I had it the function shuffle would return an array which would get assigned to this.deck.children_.

  <row Id="6474370" PostId="5036708" Score="1" Text="Yeah, digging around in the code I found that deferreds throw away their callback functions after their run. And if you mess with it so it holds onto them, then they're all called whenever you add a new callback with .done(), or .then(), etc. So you have to overwrite that behavior. Easier just to write something completely different." CreationDate="2011-04-15T04:03:09.237" UserId="586181" />

You'll have to use temporary files to read the data in and out, which would negate any benefits of shared memory in my opinion.  However, some functions like openssl_private_decrypt allow you to work with strings instead of files, which you could load and unload directly from shared memory. There are other MIME functions which may work instead of pkcs7 but I'm not that familiar.  I'd recommend looking to see if any of those functions will work for your needs."
