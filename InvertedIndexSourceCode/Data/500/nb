Regarding adding indexes - I'm guessing that you're concerned that indexing overhead might slow down inserts and updates. My experience is that for some reason people (esp. DBA's) are way too worried about indexing overhead and end up with poor SELECT performance because of it. I believe this is a case of premature optimization, i.e. worrying about a non-existent potential problem. Until you have a measureable problem, you don't have a problem. Add the indexes (or whatever) and MEASURE, MEASURE, MEASURE - then act upon that information." CreationDate="2010-10-23T00:01:36.650" UserId="213136" />

Overview: OpenSSL is in charge to prosses the round keys. For some reason the OpenSSL windows version prossess a different round key than the Linux version so the AES round keys are sent already different which leads to a different device output. We're trying to catch this bug as well. As soon as we get it I'll post the answer. Nevertheless hints are still welcome.. THanks!" CreationDate="2010-10-23T10:41:34.510" UserId="379119" />

In that case, you'll fail at load time. (2) you try to instantiate it in the Obj-C code (3) you load a nib file that instantiates it.  The original poster is suffering from a (1)-type crash.

So 480x800 will be presented to your app as 320x533, probably shaving a few pixels off horizontally or vertically for the status bar unless your activity is fullscreen."
