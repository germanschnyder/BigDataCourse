This is however a real pain for level development and pretty expensive on the old processing time. Hence since pretty much every boundary is a line it made sense to only store the start and end vector2 objects and mathematically calculate on the fly if it has been hit/crossed.

But that will be the case regardless of what type of pointer I use in the function declaration, as casting a void to a Grind::PluginManager is not going to have any effect on the structure of the underlying object, right? In any case, this is all meant to be compiled under the same environment; the dynamic libraries are mainly meant to be a way to save development time by not having to relink the entire massive application when working on these components. They will mostly be converted to static libraries for production. Something to keep in mind, though. Thanks." CreationDate="2010-12-22T09:27:39.017" UserId="19404" />
