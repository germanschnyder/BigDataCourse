The logging classes responsibility is to log all errors (for example), caching policy's responsibility is to cache values, etc.  Then you can specify at the application level how logging/caching/etc is handled and have that rule apply everywhere.

  <row Id="6842138" PostId="5934391" Score="0" Text="@T.J.: Yeah, this is very odd. I've never seen anything like this before. There is only a red line in the console tab with a text like &quot;POST http://myFoo.bar/snafu.php?eid=aParam&quot;. This looks very similar to a valid POST request in the console tab. Of course I can view the details of this request by clicking the &quot;+&quot;, but the information I got there are exactly the same that I got from a valid request, except for the response header and the response. Response header and response are just empty" CreationDate="2011-05-09T13:10:39.973" UserId="444129" />
  <row Id="6842139" PostId="5936066" Score="0" Text="Because after the hashset/map finds the bucket it must check that the item inside its bucket is the one you are asking for. Even more: hashset (that's implemented with hashmap) is an open hash, so it can hold more than one item in one bucket (a lot of times two items fall into the same bucket). It then must iterate over the bucket item list to find the correct one. If you get into the HashSet/HashMap code you'll find a key.equals(...) in the `HashMap.getEntry` method."
