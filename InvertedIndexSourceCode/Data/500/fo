Although, if you say &quot;we send out the data, clean the buffers&quot;, it looks like you could do the same with a FIFO buffer (producer/consumer queue)? Getting the &quot;Out of memory&quot; error all the time during execution seems rather dangerous (but if it's proven and works reliably, then I guess you did it right). But data processing in our application must really be done in real time, without delays, so we avoid dynamic allocation and nondeterministic behavior (and we don't need to allocate anything dynamically, data size is fixed)."
