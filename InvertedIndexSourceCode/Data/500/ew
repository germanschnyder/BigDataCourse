One algorithm for this that I learned of in grad school is to leave the tree (and any subtree) alone until one side is N times the weight of the other.  If this property holds true for any subtree after an insertion or deletion, reconstruct the tree for the highest such subtree.  This maintains O(log n) time on average."
