What happens when you use 'w' for mode instead of 'wb' on Windows is that every `\n` in the file is preceded by a spurious `\r`. Use something like `repr(open('x.csv', 'rb').read())` to see exactly what you have in the file with each mode option. Note that csv is in effect a BINARY format which uses `\r\n` as a platform-independent row terminator, and quotes `\r` and `\n` when they appear as part of the data. You don't want Windows to delete `\r` on input and insert it on output. You should use 'b' unconditionally." CreationDate="2009-11-18T06:59:12.583" UserId="84270" />

As I said - I have very minimal, if any VBA and VSTFO experience, however the rest of the team does have VBA experience. It seems you guys cleared up my worries of long term maintainability... But what about when we get to phase 2 of this project and want to automate it fully end-to-end? Can I have a Windows Service take that dirty excel output, feed it to my macro, and get the 'clean' file? Easily? and is it scalable for a nenterprise application, or is it a hack? E.G.- will I be able to re-use these 'scrubbing scripts' easily, when the app is fully automated?" CreationDate="2009-11-18T15:23:10.990" UserId="191206" />

A Glock 37 has a muzzle energy of about 441.5 J, but can drop to 70% of that value and still be acceptable for military use. A modern compound crossbow shooting a 100g arrow at 350 fps will have a shooting energy of 569 J. A state-of-the-art crossbow shooting at 400fps will punch a hole trough a two-inch thick steel plate. Moreover, in combat, you have less chances surviving being shot with an arrow, as its head remains lodged in the tissues." CreationDate="2009-11-18T19:28:07.970" UserId="147141" />
