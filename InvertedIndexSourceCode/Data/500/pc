If we were talking about a type with an `operator[]`, that would not be the case -- in that case, the compiler might be able to optimize it away if and only if it could prove that the `operator[]` did not have side-effects, but that would at least involve an optimization step.

By removing a different row, the list is re-indexed and finds values where the &quot;removed&quot; index was. Thx for help guys." CreationDate="2010-12-20T15:06:02.557" UserId="548198" />

There are 2 varibles Id, name. for most of the queries based on the Id we determine the table name and extract data. But for some Ids we have to consider names also. Like if id is 5, then we have check name if Id is 5 and name is A, then laod table A, if Id is 5 name is B then load from tableB, tableA etc... So if we use dictionary then key on the ids, then we might miss the name condition." CreationDate="2010-12-20T16:06:41.277" UserId="548824" />

This caused part of the drop-down's border to be covered and gave me the effect I needed." CreationDate="2010-12-20T17:51:46.677" UserId="285193" />
