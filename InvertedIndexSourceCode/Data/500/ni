Here is the difference in the way you and I understand language support for reference semantics. Fine C++ does support it, but you have to write wrappers for pointers yourself and overload operator= for them. `int* ip = &amp;i;` is not a reference semantics. It's a value semantics for a pointer. Anyway, I changed my answer to say, that the support is not in the same way. I hope you agree with that." CreationDate="2010-10-31T23:29:00.533" UserId="19939" />

For instance, if you use `np.seterr(all='warn')` then you will be warned about the division by 0. By the way, I would actually say that Octave is doing output 9 wrong.

It involves one extra floating-point operation compared to the second method;  it risks overflow in the rare case where `a` and `b` are huge with opposite signs (whereas the second method risks overflow in the almost equally rare case where `a` and `b` are huge with the same sign); ignoring overflow, the second method will always compute a correctly-rounded midpoint on a typical machine.
