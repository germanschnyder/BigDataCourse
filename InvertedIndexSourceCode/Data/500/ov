Databases are just collections of facts about the world. Science, maths and logic managed to describe the world accurately for centuries before SQL and nulls came along. Even in SQL, plenty of people design databases that work perfectly well without using nulls." CreationDate="2010-12-13T21:08:24.900" UserId="191708" />
