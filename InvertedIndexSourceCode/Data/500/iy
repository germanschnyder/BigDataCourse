What I am looking for is more along the lines of something that will allow me to work with strongly typed fields in custom code (since any changes to the schema that would change those fields would require a recompile anyways), while allowing the raw data to be passed into the UI framework for binding. It isn't so much about ORM, as having a strongly typed data model in the application. I've tried strongly typed DataSets, but I can't get them to pull the full schema, only the initial schema pulled into the designer." CreationDate="2010-05-31T21:57:38.997" UserId="354895" />

One advantage of this approach is that you then don't really need to create any more data entry forms. Instead, you just write a simple method to show the right sequence of data type entry forms."

Definitely use an app-specific backout queue and leave the system DLQ to the QMgr for its own uses.  In addition to the problem of DLQ headers, QMgrs are increasingly shared resources.  Many customers have had problems with one app's support team deleting another app's DLQ messages. Using app-specific backout queues eliminates this type of negative interaction."

Is there an easy way to say '1' if true  '0' if false (or is this overly expensive). I can do this in the code just as easily - but my it's my coding style to have sql return exactly the information i'm looking for as opposed to interpreting it with code afterwards. I can see my example doesn't make it obvious that this is what I'm looking for. Thanks" CreationDate="2010-06-02T09:56:05.020" UserId="181707" />

Even when closing the application being debugged and quitting gdb, the output will not appear. The output really is gone! So it seems something is going on that goes beyond buffering output ..."
