The problem your newest edit has is that it says everything is 200....the problem you had with the edit before that is that it for over 9999 hours, it said brian was making 200...not the expected 350.  So basically on Brian's 9999th hour he was making 350 an hour, and then when he reached 10000, he dropped down to 200 an hour...that is **not** correct. He should make atleast the highest `highhours` wage.  I should not have used 9999 in my original example because its large and unrealistic." CreationDate="2010-08-22T05:06:47.583" UserId="130204" />
