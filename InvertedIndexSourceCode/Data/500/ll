For each case, you write an assertion in your unit test. Then, if your actual code fails an assertion, you know that your code has a bug in it, and you've implemented your logic incorrectly. Since units are small, and your assertion tests specific code in the unit, it should be easy to pinpoint where your logic error is. The important thing is that you write your assertions first. Then make your code pass. Can you point out where this process stunts anything but bug-growth?" CreationDate="2010-08-30T17:19:49.317" UserId="27583" />

Delphi's unit files are not &quot;broken&quot; but your assertion that &quot;one class per unit/file&quot; has no technical or organizational merit is flawed. Its merit lies in the speed of comprehension. As developers we spend 80%-90% of our time reading and understanding source code and only 10%-20% modifying it. Sifting through 30 marginally related classes in a file to modify only 1 of them is a time waster. Delphi's libraries were designed with multiple classes per file but the compiler certainly doesn't force this on anyone. As @Wouter points out it only encourages tight coupling."
