With a stack you can start programming in C. Next would be a board-specific subroutine (assuming the stack is in internal RAM) for hardware initialization such as setting up access to external memory and setting up a faster system clock. Many microcontrollers start up on a very slow low-power clock, the faster clock then speeds up the initialization of the .data and .bss segments."

FOr instance look at your example, you have Cat 0 1. Meaning it was the first time product_cat came up so you assigned cat_ident 1. Then you have Dog 0 2, you saw that the product_cat already existed one time so all you did was add 1 to the count and assign it to Cat_Ident so you got the value 2. So it is a simple SQL Count by groupping: `SELECT Product_Cat, COUNT(*) FROM YourTable GROUP BY Product_Cat` That will give you a count of each group."

It's a WPF app that creates a new Stopwatch object on startup, then kicks it off via .Start(). I then create a DispatcherTimer like so:&#xA;&#xA;displayTimer = new DispatcherTimer();&#xA;displayTimer.Tick += display_Tick;&#xA;displayTimer.Interval = DISPLAY_INTERVAL_TIMESPAN;&#xA;&#xA;where the timespan is 200 ms. My debug code simply prints out the value of the Stopwatch object everytime the dispatchTimer ticks. &#xA;&#xA;I'm almost out of characters, but I'd like to display additional debug info."

EventTriggers are almost never fired more than a 1 or 2 times per second, but a condition can easily change thousands of times per second.  So the safest course for general purpose use is to do the work during the event trigger.  It also takes a lot less code my way, for two reasons:  1.  With the way you suggest you have to use an ObservableCollection for Actions and handle INotifyCollectionChanged to update the dummy trigger, which is a lot of code, and 2.
