As for why you'd use a DateTime: if you're working with a *time of day* that relates to a time rather than a time duration, I think it makes more conceptual sense to stick with a time which represents that. Why would you store/work with a period when you're interseted in a time of day? Ideally of course, there should be a data type representing &quot;time of day&quot; rather than &quot;period&quot; or &quot;duration&quot; - which is where Noda Time comes in :)" CreationDate="2009-11-10T10:44:47.963" UserId="22656" />

For example, an ORM typically keeps all database-specific code separate so that SQL Server code doesn't mix with Oracle code for example. You still need implementation-specific code for each database, but you've added another layer on top of it (the object persistence layer) that stays the same even when the underlying database changes, so you are never mixing code for different databases together - each database-specific data access layer is in a self-contained library."
