Just like the highlight around the edges of a button and similar effects on other controls, the blue selection indicates that your listview currently has the input focus. When the listview does *not* have the focus, but its selection is still visible, it turns gray instead of blue.

After some work on properly indexing the audit data, the query plan for the individual reporting entity constructing procedures does not include parallelism.  The trick is that I have a collection of these entity building procedures that are called in turn from the managing procedure, thus it must wait for entity 1's proc to complete before calling entity 2's proc and so on.  Each proc is consuming only 1 core and I only need to wait for all of them to be done, it doesn't matter which order.  Thanks for the SSIS link, new skills are great."

The main language in the standard (non-footnotes, etc.) seems to leave enough variables in play that I thought the safer play was to assume no specific sizes ever, in general.  I was also surprised to see something like `LONG_MAX` having a value specified by the standard -- I thought the point of such a macro was to enable implementation definition."
