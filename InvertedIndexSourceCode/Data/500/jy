I need to do a join because the actual tables that I am running the query on do not have a FK relationship. I only used the Northwind tables as examples. I need a group join, I do not want to flatten the list. Hence the title of the question. In other words, I would like the results to return a category and it's list of products, but I don't want the categories with no products to be included. But the point wasn't really, whether I could run the query without group but how I can do a group by that produces a single inner join query."
