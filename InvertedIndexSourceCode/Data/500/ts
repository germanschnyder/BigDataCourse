When there isn't the separator in the values, it's simple to write a CSV file with Python, even without the module **csv** of Python. To manage cases in which the separator can be in the values, there are formatting parameters to use, available in the **csv** module. This module is easy to employ."

If it gets installed on the wrong PC then you can cancel access for the associated client cert and re-enable the token so that the installer can be re-used. But I think this is overkill."

In a multiset, potentially there are a lot of matches, so at absolute theoretical best it does an upper and a lower search and then figures out the number of nodes in between using records stored in the nodes.
