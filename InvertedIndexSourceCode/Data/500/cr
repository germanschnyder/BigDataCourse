But in the general case if a constructor has bad inputs you MUST throw an exception. The other choice is to have an invalid object. An invalid object will not obey any constraints applied to its methods. So the real solution here: inputs from the user are validated (bad data generates an error message) then used in the constructor (which will throw if the validation failed (which is good))."
