Based on your info, I don't think I have a choice but to keep the schema info inside the mapping file and change it when I'm done with testing. I have at least two production schemas so setting a default schema in the factory would require a factory for every schema, or having the schema property set for some mappings but not others. I've read that factories are heavy and to avoid more than one so I think I'm left with changing just the schema properties in the mapping files. I wish I could create a mapping interface and override just the property instead. Thanks Again." CreationDate="2009-10-30T12:42:14.423" UserId="134363" />
