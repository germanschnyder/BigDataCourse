In .NET, many of those controls and features I was forced to write for FLEX, are built into the framework. I cringe at the thought of adding a Combobox column to my already extended CheckboxDataGrid. In .NET, it's as simple as turning an attribute to &quot;ON&quot; for both checkbox and combobox columns. What took me 3 weeks in FLEX to write, takes me 5 minutes in .NET to enable. See my point?"
