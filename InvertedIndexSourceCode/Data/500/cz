Under &quot;src/fitnesse/&quot; I found &quot;FitNesseExpediter.java&quot; and &quot;FitNesseExpediterTest.java&quot;, among many other pairs of production/test classes. Unfortunately, there is only one test suite that I could find, and those tests seem to be mostly integration tests. Take &quot;testAuthenticationGetsCalled&quot; for example: it asserts that &quot;response.getStatus()&quot; is 401, but the method tested (&quot;createGoodResponse&quot;) actually delegates this responsability to another class, &quot;Responder&quot;."
