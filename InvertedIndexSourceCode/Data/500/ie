Though forgive me for being a LINQ newbie, but I'm still trying to wrap my head around what is going on under the hood. What's confusing to me is that it would seem that an Anonymous type would still return references to each value, such that when the value in a field of the DataGridView is altered, the XML data in the XDocument is simultaneously altered as well. So are you saying that if I create a class that can contain those values, that I'll be able to get what I'm seeking?" CreationDate="2010-04-29T13:06:49.477" UserId="21244" />

I'm all for questions on performance optimization when the performance is really an issue, but &quot;optimizing&quot; two arithmetic comparisons isn't a very useful exercise.  We're literally talking about maybe 20 CPU instructions; if you had to process 1 **billion** values, that savings translates to 1 out of 10 seconds.  Less than the time it would take to *produce* the data in the first place." CreationDate="2010-04-29T20:03:51.107" UserId="38360" />
