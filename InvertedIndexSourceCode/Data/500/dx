I would assume that the whole point of passing `node` as a reference would be that it can be modified from inside the function. Also the function name `instantiateNode` seems to suggest that it would create a new node, probably by modifying it's parameter. And about copying a pointer, do you mean `Node *copy = node;`?"

Both queries are going to be exactly the same on either index; which one of the **indexes** will make queries perform faster depends on how many matching rows are in the table / index.
