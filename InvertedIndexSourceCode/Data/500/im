The implementation of `min` provides an example of `reduce` being used with a function which does not have a nullary implementation in Clojure itself. Also, the unary case is never used by Clojure's `reduce`; a sequence of length 1 is always reduced to its only element. Ultimately you need a nullary case if you're going to deal with empty sequences (if you're willing to treat them as erroneous input, you can do without it) and you definitely need a binary case (if you're never going to deal with sequences of length &gt; 1, there's no point to using `reduce` anyway)."
