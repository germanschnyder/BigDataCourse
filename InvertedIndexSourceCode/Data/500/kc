But sadly, `new SomeClass[]{1, 2, 3}` is not valid (because it wants an expression in the brackets. `new (int[]){1, 2, 3}` is different, but that case is obscured by weird wording in the FCD it seems, which makes GCC reject it by saying &quot;error: invalid use of array with unspecified bounds&quot;. The Standard does not describe how new-expressions handle the type &quot;T[]&quot; (which is incomplete), but one could interpret it as saying it's analoguous to `T t[] = { ... }`, which would make the *allocated type* (see 5.3.4/1) complete.

Now granted, there's the `LongLength` property which reports the array size as an `Int64` - but it still reports it as a signed value. The overriding consideration in these cases is the fact that the designers of .NET chose to make unsigned types non-CLS compliant. Something that's unlikely to ever change at this point."
