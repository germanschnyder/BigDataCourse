My point was that having the object instead of the primitive might make for less changes, in particular for equality comparison (maybe a better example would help). Less changes; less chances for bugs perhaps. I also see what you're saying about the object efficiency relative to the primitive efficiency, but again, there's the issue of whether that difference is a bottleneck in the system."
