It is often done that way when you have *multiple* variable length arrays in the struct. However, it is not as easy as you suggest. In general you have to make sure that the array memory is properly aligned. Your `(int *) (ptr_to_s + 1)` does not ensure that. Two allocations would solve that problem automatically. &quot;Struct hack&quot; does as well. But with pointer and one allocation it is your responsibility to take care of alignment."
