My point is that the limitations (which exist) aren't reason enough to pass up the advantages (which also exist) since it's pretty doable to use side-by-side with ADO.  Some limitations are lack of POCO, limited designer support, lack of batch updates, poor integration with views, lack of support for &quot;non-core&quot; operations (e.g. INSERT OR IGNORE), and thus suboptimal performance in update scenarios.  Oh, and the API is overcomplex on the matter of entity versioning.  Anyway, most of these aren't issues for 95% of all queries, and it's OK to use the odd fallback."

In general, it's better to let compiler and optimizers deal with this stuff and just write good code in your favorite language.
