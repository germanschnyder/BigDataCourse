The topic was about Cython but my reply - the one you are commenting on - is talking about the possibility of using C directly on the string data. And the problems with using typical C algorithms on the strings are not restricted to pre-Unicode charsets like gb and big5 but extend to any variable-length encoding, such as UCS2, which what a Python unicode object stores and exposes to the C API."
