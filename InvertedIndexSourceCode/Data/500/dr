The vector approach doesn't use pointers so it's 'safer' as you don't need to remember to call delete [].  vector's manage their own internal buffers, so the chance of a buffer overflow is minimal. (though using the [] operator disables bounds checking, you could use the at() method which will perform bounds checking). vectors grow their internal buffer automatically, so you don't need to. Using a vector means you can use iterators and the std algorithms. Generally, using a std::vector over a bare array is the preferred approach with idioatic C++."

And the runtime and interpreter have a lot of internal structures that need to be protected. Even if you don't care if you allow a python program to crash the interpreter you need a GIL or some synchronization." CreationDate="2009-09-22T13:19:07.913" UserId="155082" />

In this case, the compiler can optimize it because it's local. however, if the const object was a reference (via a real reference or by dereferencing a pointer-to-const) and the compiler couldn't determine that it was aliased (assuming there's a function call inside the for loop that allows the aliasing to have an effect)there would be no additional optimization opportunities due to the const qualifier.
