When `size_t` is used for that purpose, it exposes the fact that the container is array-based. And if it is not really array-based, then using `size_t` is a major and obvious design error. Moreover, even if it is indeed array-based, `size_t` in interface notably defeats the purpose of using pimpl, since it &quot;unhides&quot; a major property of the implementation."
