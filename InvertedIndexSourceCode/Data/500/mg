It's better if your design does not necessitates a downcast, however if you are stuck with a `AbstractInfoPtr` and need a more derived object, then go ahead and downcast. There is no facility (you cannot use `static_cast` directly) so you have to do it manually: 1. get the pointer and cast it, 2. if it succeeds assign it to another `unique_ptr`, 3. release it from the first. In case of a `static_cast`, you can short-cut 2. which gives: `unique_ptr&lt;MyInfoObject&gt; myinfo ( static_cast&lt;MyInfoObject*&gt;(info.release()) );`.
