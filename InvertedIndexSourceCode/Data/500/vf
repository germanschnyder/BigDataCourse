If you look at the source code in .NET you see that some types behave the same when doing `Close` or `Dispose`, while others don't. I think it is safe to say that you shouldn't count on `Close` to properly free your resources. For instance, the `SqlConnection` does not call `GC.SuppressFinalize(this)` during a call to this, which force the object to live much longer than strictly needed. Therefore, you can conclude that your statement is true and the guideline holds: If an instance implements `IDisposable`: you should call dispose."

I wonder: Could it be that the xib in question was last used in Xcode3, and Xcode 4 is doing some conversion behind the scenes? Or, are you seeing this any time you select a xib file, whether it's the first time selecting it in Xcode4 or not? Are there any git settings where your file is read-only and perhaps Xcode is changing the permissions so you can edit it? That might account for the modified status."
