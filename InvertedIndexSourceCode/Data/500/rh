Surface s =&gt; s`, so values in that field must be valid values of _every_ `Surface` type.  The only possible such value is `undefined` and the like (since the `Surface` class defines no functions that yield `s`).  What you're looking for is the `ExistentialTypes` extension, not `RankNTypes`, and the `Surface s =&gt;` context would go before the data constructor, i.e. `data Renderable = forall s. Surface s =&gt; Renderable ...` if I'm remembering the syntax correctly.  That should be enough to google anyway ;)" CreationDate="2011-02-15T15:17:09.670" UserId="450670" />
