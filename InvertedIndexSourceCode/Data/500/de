In simplifying the code and working from my original question, I have messed up something.  The difference between what you have and what I want is that I want to create a list with an instance of each object.  So in the foreach loop, I create a new instance of the object (which works fine), but when I add it to the list&lt;object&gt;, I get a runtime error saying that the object is null.  Ironically, I can examine the object in the Locals window and see that it is not null.  This may be due to my reading the types at runtime." CreationDate="2009-08-20T11:05:42.587" UserId="73428" />
