I'm pretty sure the reason it works out this way is because this method's step works out to be a really roundabout way of approximating the Newton-Raphson step. Repeating average-damp m times is the same as computing f(y) = (1 - 1/2^m)y + x/(2^m y^(n-1)).  Letting m be log2(n) makes the step function f(y) = (1 - 1/n)y + x/(ny^(n-1)), which is exactly the one Newton-Raphson would use.  Using the floor of that makes it a (good enough) approximation, so I'd say your intuition in the post is spot on." CreationDate="2011-02-23T13:51:39.073" UserId="450670" />
