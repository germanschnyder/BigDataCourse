You may not even *need* an instance of the object in question - such as for utility methods, as you mention. In fact, I tend to try to actively *avoid* putting resource-laden types (which generally require cleanup) into an object's state. It means you need to pay much more attention to the lifetime of the object. I generally obtain the resources within a method, store them as local variables, quite possibly passing them to other (possibly static) methods, then clean them up. I find that's simpler."
