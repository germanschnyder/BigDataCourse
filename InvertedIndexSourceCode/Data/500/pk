The standard reads (6.3.1.3): &quot;Otherwise, if the new type is unsigned, the value is converted by repeatedly adding or subtracting one more than the maximum value that can be represented in the new type until the value is in the range of the new type&quot;. There is no language about modulo or 2 raised to the power of the number of representation bits. C clearly allows padding bits in unsigned types."

It would be nice to consider something like e.g. .NET metadata tables, which use a conciser representation.
