You ask why use interop at all, if you can't identify one of those problem issues. One possibility (it's our situation) is that the app works fine, we have the source, we have Vb6 people &amp; the changes we wish to make are small - *relative to the size of the whole app*. But, although the changes we wish to make are small relative to the whole app (built up over 15+ years), it's still a reasonable chunk of work.
