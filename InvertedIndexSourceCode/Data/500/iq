We don't know about structure at this point, isn't there a high probability of there being an edge &lt;4,12&gt; with cost 1? I know that later on we choose to examine 4, but why not choose it straight away after examining 1?

This is normally dreadful practice, to be avoided, and it means you can't change the event handler without recreating the HTML (and hence leaking memory).
