Having looked at the data a bit since posting this, I think most of the data is actually page views, increasing by 50+ per day - so I could simply archive page views over a week old. That would solve the problem for this site.

Handlers bound to actual elements fire before those bound with `live` or `delegate` (of course); I don't know whether they guarantee what happens if multiple `live` handlers handle to the same element, don't immediately see it in the docs, but I suspect it's the same (order of `live` calls). :-)" CreationDate="2010-11-04T15:09:02.007" UserId="157247" />

For a hdpi device, a 120 x 160 pixel image will appear roughly 0.5&quot; x 0.67&quot;, while on your mdpi the same image will be roughly 0.75&quot; x 1&quot;, due to the different pixel densities.
