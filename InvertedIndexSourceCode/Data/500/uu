When you say the origin, I would assume it is the origin of the rect that I am passing CGPathAddEllipseInRect.

If it were the origin for the screen, then I assume I'd see it do a quarter of its rotation in the bottom corner of the screen which also isn't happening.

  <row Id="6664037" PostId="5809027" Score="0" Text="Makes absolute sense. So how would I be able to clean those from my app? I need to call recycle() myself? It also seems that the practice of using a SoftReference for a drawable cache is not helpful (not unless you are developing in HC).&#xA;&#xA;Also, I've read somewhere before the we should not just 'nullify' the drawable reference. For example do not do bitmap = null; as this has no effect. Instead just call bitmap.recycle() only.&#xA;&#xA;recycle() seems a better option as it probably includes some native calls to cleanup the bitmap from Skia.&#xA;&#xA;Any recommendations, best practices?&#xA;&#xA;Thanks for response!"
