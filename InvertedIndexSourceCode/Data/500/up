So it location will change and the old one will stay to same.&#xA;Second is I can't use copy, because it a mutable object. Again preferred work around other than using mutableCopy(preferred on the property itself).&#xA;Third is, is it using (if it's a property) &quot;test = [alloc]; test = nil; test = [alloc]&quot; and &quot;test = [alloc]; test = [alloc]&quot; the same?

Personally, I use Backup and Migrate for scheduled safety backups via cron, and quick &quot;just in case&quot; backups when testing new code.  Since everything is done via Drupal admin or drush, it is very quick.  I use MySQL Administrator for full migrations and large scale backup/restores.  I really don't like phpmyadmin.  YMMV."

Yes, I know that a URL is a URI, but there is something distinctly recognizable about a URL. It has a protocol, a domain, a suffix, folder references, and, most of the time, a document. It has been made clear to me that the XML namespace format is what it is simply because original XML ganstas made a decision based on their understanding of how things would work at the time.

But if the parent swf width and height were set to 1 each, the streaming started again. b) There was considerable lag between the time the parent swf file receives data and the by the time it updates all the child swfs. This lag was sometimes very visible, and there was no lag at all sometimes. Every swf file has real time data. So this is bad." CreationDate="2011-04-23T09:39:23.953" UserId="669557" />

As I understand, if x * x is prohibited, so we always deal with a linear equation with actually only one variable. So, this is just a method of solving such equation, and (ax+b)/(cx+d) is a common form for any linear equation. Am I right? Also, it is a little bit confusing that we have (ax+b)/(cx+d)=0 equation but use x=-b/a. Why do we need c and d at all? Thank you" CreationDate="2011-04-23T10:08:45.593" UserId="194635" />

I mean, it even doesn't save you typing. `ConstantArray[1, 10^7]` is longer than `Table[1, {10^7}]` and filling a table is so speedy that the difference (which when given as a factor is considerable) isn't really interesting.

Say you are having 2 strings, one for first name and the other for last name. There is high probability that more than 1 person can have the same first name. Do you think JVM should have both their first names pointed to the same memory location? What if the 3rd person has a different first name? How does JVM handle that? Pointed to be noted is that whenever you are saying &quot;new&quot; in Java, it creates a separate memory location." CreationDate="2011-04-23T19:22:28.193" UserId="640607" />

I've experimented with all of these DND-related objects, but they don't actually upload anything. As I said I could use an XHR object to send the dropped file to another PHP file, but I'm working with existing code and I want to minimize changes as much as possible. There are a lot of other parameters that need to be passed when uploading a file. What I really need is some way to upload files without any sort of destination. I don't know if that's possible though." CreationDate="2011-04-23T19:23:38.057" UserId="721812" />
