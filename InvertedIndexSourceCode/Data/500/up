So it location will change and the old one will stay to same.&#xA;Second is I can't use copy, because it a mutable object. Again preferred work around other than using mutableCopy(preferred on the property itself).&#xA;Third is, is it using (if it's a property) &quot;test = [alloc]; test = nil; test = [alloc]&quot; and &quot;test = [alloc]; test = [alloc]&quot; the same?

Personally, I use Backup and Migrate for scheduled safety backups via cron, and quick &quot;just in case&quot; backups when testing new code.  Since everything is done via Drupal admin or drush, it is very quick.  I use MySQL Administrator for full migrations and large scale backup/restores.  I really don't like phpmyadmin.  YMMV."

Yes, I know that a URL is a URI, but there is something distinctly recognizable about a URL. It has a protocol, a domain, a suffix, folder references, and, most of the time, a document. It has been made clear to me that the XML namespace format is what it is simply because original XML ganstas made a decision based on their understanding of how things would work at the time.

So, this is just a method of solving such equation, and (ax+b)/(cx+d) is a common form for any linear equation. Am I right?

I mean, it even doesn't save you typing. `ConstantArray[1, 10^7]` is longer than `Table[1, {10^7}]` and filling a table is so speedy that the difference (which when given as a factor is considerable) isn't really interesting.
