In the link you gave, the type of the function call is actually already known at compile time, that why it can be implemented in a switch-case manner. We can call it compile time plymorphism.

The Zend_Db classes offers the data access patterns from PoEAA, but these are not mapping to any model classes on purpose, because ZF leaves it to the developer to design the Model, because the Model is the application.

Like said in the beginning, ZF has a use-at-will architecture. This gives ZF a flexibility beyond any other PHP framework. If you don't like the DB package, don't use it, use Doctrine, Propel or whatever you like. That's not uncommon. If you don't like Zend_Form, use whatever you find more appropriate. Use your approach if you like. This flexibility is exactly why I think ZF or Zend_Form is not obtrusive and why I downvoted the answer (even though the approach you give works)."

You should just understand that counting characters in 10,000,000 with this or similar length takes a few seconds. Consequently, for 10,000 strings (regardless of same string or different strings) it would take a few ms. So you're trying to optimize code that takes a few ms to complete. That's a plain useless effort. So settle for a simple implementation using charAt() - none of the suggestions here is faster anyway." CreationDate="2010-03-10T16:58:47.017" UserId="178526" />
