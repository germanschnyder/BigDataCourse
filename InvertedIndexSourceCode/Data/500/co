  <row Id="930009" PostId="1114326" Score="0" Text="@Kam: Like statenjason said, you should use an ArrayList, which precisely implements a dynamic array in Java. If you really wanted to implement it yourself, you would double the size of the array allocated when it gets full and you need to add more. (You also need to keep track of the current size in a separate variable.) The way you are doing it is very inefficient -- every time you add something it has to copy the entire array, making adding an element O(n). However, if you double the size (or increase it by any fixed percentage) when it gets full, then adding becomes amortized O(1)." CreationDate="2009-07-11T18:51:56.457" UserId="86989" />

The CMD[x] where x = 0 ... 10 are test conditions that return either 1 or 0; mostly is the process running or not and similar to the pgrep example given above.  Along with CMD, I have a corresponding RESTART[x] that I call and after I call it, I re-evaluate the CMD[x] to see if the process restarted.  In other examples I am checking for presence of a log file.  I didn't want to bore the forum with these details but it would probably have been helpful.&#xA;Thank you!"
