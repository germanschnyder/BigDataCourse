By writing an actual sql statement in your PLSQL code, you benefit from code completion and compile time checks which make debugging easier. You can use `SELECT BULK COLLECT INTO` to select the result of an entire query in an in memory dataset, which can also be traversed, altered, extended and returned from the function. Other than that, it is pretty similar. I wouldn't dare say my way is better, although it is, of course. ;)" CreationDate="2010-12-29T22:16:29.103" UserId="511529" />

The other implicit assumption that you carry along is that pointer types all have the same width as `void*`. So your solution is a valid test for `void*`. Maybe on weird archs there are data pointers that are narrower. And then, you don't capture function pointers. They are not even conversion compatible with `void*`. But yeah, you solved the &quot;missing prototype for `malloc` problem&quot;. Great!" CreationDate="2010-12-30T08:18:41.153" UserId="366377" />

One thing I might add is that it appears your VLOOKUP function needs &quot;false&quot; added as the last parameter; this will force exact matches only. Also, for the multi-column reuse, it appears that if you wrap the column that's being output like this &quot;COLUMN(A1)&quot; in the third parameter, that it will convert the column name to a numeral for VLOOKUP to use; which is only of use if the columns being matched are in the order you need and share the same lookup key; so, for your code example, it would work."
