I'll take a look at how they do threading though.. My current app loads the rows as they come in, and stops them if you scroll past the image. The only problem is that they are not inserted into the table untill the table stops scrolling, and I don't exactly know why. I think even though my image loading occurs asynchronously, it's not really in a separate thread, hence it waits for the table to stop scrolling."
