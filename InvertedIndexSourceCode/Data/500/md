Think about this: Why don't those people on the Perl 5 mailing list go any further after looking at the C source?  Why don't they have to look at the C compiler's source code to figure out what the compiler will do with Perl's source, then look at CPU gate layouts to see what the CPU will do with the binary code?  That's right, it's because C compilers and CPUs are designed to a spec!  OK, I'm done whining now :)" CreationDate="2010-09-23T01:51:18.210" UserId="47984" />

Yes, when you do `Dim eValue As LockModes` and then type `eValue =`, IntelliSense shows you the `enum` members. _However_, if you type `eValue = LockModes.`, IntelliSense doesn't work correctly, and if you type `eValue = LockModes.LockMethod`, you will get a compile error saying that `LockModes` is not defined. That is the real issue here. VB6 can auto-complete the list if you don't use the `enum` name in your code , but if you do use the `enum` name (i.e. `LockModes.LockMethod`), it does not work."

The problem you have is that gvim is a graphical editor and launches in the background (of the console). So the console call `gvim` immediately returns and git uses the (unchanged by that time) commit message file. *Then* you get the focus of the vim window, and change the file. But at that time, git's job is already done. So you need to make the gvim call not return before you close the window. And `-f` does exactly that."
