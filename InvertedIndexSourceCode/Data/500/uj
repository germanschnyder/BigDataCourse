As far as I'm aware the only situation they are async is in editable content in WebKit (although this may change). For example, try the following in Firefox 4: `var div = document.createElement('div'), a = &quot;sync&quot;; div.addEventListener('DOMNodeInserted', function(){ console.log(&quot;Inserted &quot; + a); }, false); div.appendChild(document.createElement(&quot;br&quot;)); a = &quot;async&quot;;` Also, your code doesn't work in WebKit: it seems you need to add the div into the document for the event to fire."
