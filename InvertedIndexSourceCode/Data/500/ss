Sadly for pre-MVC 3 you had to specify your own implementation of the data attribute by inheriting from DisplayAttribute and fetching the string from a resource file (I pass resource Type and resource key as parameters). This takes 10 minutes to write once and can be reused. Luckily this was resolved in MVC 3 with support for the DisplayAttribute(resourceKey, resourceType) overload that was ignored due to conflicting dates between MVC 2 release and the model decoration attributes."

But in general, how you've summarized it for `Concat` isn't correct; the inferred type-argument should be one of the element-types of the sequence. So `new string[0].Concat(new FileInfo[0])` wouldn't work; you would have to explicitly specify the right type-argument: `new string[0].Concat&lt;object&gt;(new FileInfo[0])`. Also note that covariant conversions don't work when the type-argument of the constructed type is a value-type." CreationDate="2011-03-17T12:44:40.687" UserId="412770" />
