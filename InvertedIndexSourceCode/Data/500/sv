And, I know this is picky, but your use of `width: 24%` means there is some (uneven) unused space at the right edge. I know that if you put `width: 25%`, the `1px` borders will push the last button down due to the combined `width: 100% + borders`. The easiest solution is to put the borders on the `&lt;a&gt;` tags instead (along with a couple of other tweaks)." CreationDate="2011-03-18T21:41:30.460" UserId="405015" />

As for using jQuery to enhance your form, yes this is possible. You would need to select the element you wish to add the event handler to (span) but need to be specific. Something along the lines of `$('SELECTOR').click(function() { $('SELECTOR OF FORM ID').submit(); });` will submit the form when the chosen span is clicked. Check out the jQuery docs to learn more: http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials. Sorry not more specific, going to bed now, but will take a look in the morning. Good Luck!"
