There is a way around this using views, but it is a contrived solution. You can solve the salt problem by implementing your own realm, but solving the group/role mapping issue is harder I think."

I think the hard part would be to achieve something that was readable and easily understandable. You may also have to bring in threading configuration unless you went thread-safe by default. Getting some nice clear syntax would be tricky. `public Bling B { lazyget  : new Bling(); }` :)" CreationDate="2011-01-06T17:28:03.527" UserId="189516" />

My code reads selected lines from the input file into a StringBuilder object sb, then displays that in a TextView using `tv.setText(Html.fromHtml(sb.toString()));` For 50 &quot;lines&quot; (or paragraphs) averaging about 1KB per line the 3 lines of code: `		setContentView(R.layout.displaytext);&#xA;		TextView tv = (TextView)findViewById(R.id.display_text);&#xA;		tv.setText(Html.fromHtml(text.toString()));&#xA;` take 5 seconds or more to process.
