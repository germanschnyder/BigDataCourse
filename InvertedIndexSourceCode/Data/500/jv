  <row Id="3278513" PostId="3183587" Score="2" Text="+1 answer. I personally think that jQuery encourages a very specific pattern of coding that makes a lot of older JavaScript programmers cringe. For example, jQuery encourages the most ridiculous nesting and chaining of commands (e.g. `$('div.id1').parent().css({'display':'inline'}).end().hover(function(){$(this).css({'border':'1px solid blue'})})`. There are good reasons to do this, but it does sometimes make it very difficult to make sense of.

A pattern I've seen is to have a &quot;context&quot; object passed around that contains all the variables that might otherwise be global, so that 1) you don't have to thread them all separately and 2) you can pass a new context when calling someone without affecting you or your callers."

Unless every 32-byte string results in a new and completely unique 32-byte string, you've introduced a new range of collisions.
