It's included in 1-4, so no problem, but better keep that in mind when doing the maths for projections etc. Because searching intersection point without considering the parallel case often cause nasty errors. For example, the check for 5 need to watch this (intersection of each edge with the other polygon's plane)." CreationDate="2011-02-25T06:27:28.643" UserId="157119" />

Thats what I thought, but if I clone a single object, that does not somehow automatically clone the referenced objects does it?
