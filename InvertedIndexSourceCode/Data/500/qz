The way you have it, the callback function never fires (syntax issue I think).  That part is fixed.  Now when you overshoot the menu image during animation, the drawer simply stops and closes.  You can only move inside the drawer when it's fully opened.  (ideally, I'd like the drawer to just finish opening &amp; stay open when the mouse enters during animation).  Increasing duration will reduce the chance of failure.  Also interested in your wisdom... [link](http://jsfiddle.net/PayFw/5/)" CreationDate="2011-02-07T23:02:27.507" UserId="594235" />
