Better to just use plain old `IList&lt;Customer&gt;`.  For most purposes, you're not going to want to change the public interface of your collection class anyway, so you won't lose anything.

Thus you have a situation where you cannot easily track and have to resort to a Weak hack. The only proper way is to be explicit and utilise the Disposable concept. Simple lifetime management, not amortising and causing even more pain down the road. All of which leads to a catastrophic leak and OutOfMemory exceptions on any decent scale app, yet the GC sits idle, takes ages to catch this rather simple problem it is meant to avoid epsecially with many VM implementers shouting how reference-counting was flawed."

If you take every number which is representable as a decimal, between every adjacent pair of them there are an infinity of real numbers which are not representable as a decimal.  Same is true for the doubles.  But these are completely different sets of numbers.  For any arbitrary real number, that falls randomly on the real number line, it will either be closer to one of the decimals, or to one of the doubles."
