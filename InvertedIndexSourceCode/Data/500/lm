The best way to debug something like this is to find the SQL statement in the log file and execute it manually in the DB client. Then you could take off the GROUP BY entirely, and it would show you each row that it is selecting. You could tweak the columns in the SELECT so that you can find out what's going on. It will be worthwhile for you to do this exercise, it will be a very useful learning tool and something you'll use a lot in the future." CreationDate="2010-08-31T16:31:51.903" UserId="237150" />
