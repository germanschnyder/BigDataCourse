For your second question, if you don't initialise your variables in your custom class, it depends on the compiler as to what happens. Some compilers set variables to 0 if they're not specifially set by you (unless your tell them not to using compiler options such as optimisation), and in others it's the default not to do anything. Therefore, you can usually get away with it doing nothing if you set an array of 10,000 elements like that." CreationDate="2010-04-07T14:33:45.537" UserId="281201" />

The two critical parts to me were how the dates can be operated on arithmetically to intersect them and how you separated the date range into individual days to process them.

I just thought you can't put decisions in a hand of guys coming out college for their first year of real development job. I know for myself, I thought I was quite good 5 years ago but in reality I knew sh!t.

What about the Perl 5.10 regex extensions make them not regular? &#xA;&#xA;This regex uses a named group and an atomic group. I think most modern regex flavors have exactly this or a close variant. &#xA;&#xA;Look at the wikipedia comparison of regex flavors. Only Java, Ruby and Python currently lack the atomic grouping used, but I am sure it will soon be added. &#xA;&#xA;http://www.regular-expressions.info/atomic.html  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_regular_expression_engines" CreationDate="2010-04-07T20:23:29.437" UserId="298607" />

Unless perhaps the implementation could detect when you're trying to stringize NULL, and substitute some magic.

I read 4.1.5 as saying &quot;ICE 0 and ICE 0 cast to void* must be legal forms of the null pointer constant&quot;, not that they are the only legal forms of the null pointer constant.
