If you have to write a one-off sql statement, just do your best to encapsulate that data access code in a class somewhere using a pattern that is consistent throughout your application. It doesn't have to be hideous. ;) I've got projects where there's a class called 'sprocs' that contains code for getting into all my stored procedures. So I can do something like: myData = Sprocs.AuthorNames, and it's very consistent. Many ORM tools auto-generate that kind of stuff for you, which is nice."
