In your solution, you do not take care of milliseconds: for instance `0.1` is not `1ms` it is actually `100ms`, as it should be read `0.100`. Besides you assume the order in which PHP will evaluate the `array_pop` - since there are only `+`, the *precedence* of operators does not intervene, but unless it is specifically written that in `a + b + c` PHP will start with `a`, then with `b` and finally with `c` (I don't know), it is a wrong assumption.

In my example I thought `save()` was being fed only with the arrays contents, not considering that `$a` and `$b` were actually different objects. In fact, in the JS example, there was a `findOne()` before the &quot;upsert&quot;. This `findOne()` appears in the PHP `update()`, as you well said, in `$filter=array('_id'=&gt;'test_a');` so that whatever comes in the next argument will be inserted into this object.
