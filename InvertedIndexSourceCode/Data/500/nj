For example, the Gothic block runs from U+10330 GOTHIC LETTER AHSA through U+1034A GOTHIC LETTER NINE HUNDRED but also includes the next five code points, currently unnamed?  How do you in Python express what other programming languages allow you to use `\p{Gothic}`, `\p{Script=Gothic}`, `\p{InGothic}`, or `\p{Block=Gothic}` for?  For example, in Perl, `/\pN/ &amp;&amp; /\p{InGothic}/` yields U+10341 GOTHIC LETTER NINETY and U+1034A GOTHIC LETTER NINE HUNDRED. That doesn't work in Python, though; why not?"

The line you quote gets the pointer to the beginning of the scanline[j] and increments it by &quot;i&quot; positions. As Delphi permits not incrementing pointers, we first need to cast it to an integer, then increment (as if it was integer), then cast back to PByte to retrieve the value it points to. Also check the answer, added working example. Can't believe I had to fire up Delphi and debug that myself." CreationDate="2010-11-02T13:48:59.873" UserId="360447" />

Your application posts an asynchronous read, then invokes `io_service::run` exactly once. When the data arrives, your read handler is invoked. This is exactly the same behavior as a synchronous read, except the control flow is inverted. Inside the handler, you post additional async operations depending on what your application needs to do.

All apps on OS X look different and, worse, from OS X to OS X versions and depending on apps updates, the look &amp; feel of your app can change.  iTunes, which is kinda used, comes to mind.  There are hardly two iTunes version that have the same interface (the positions of the '+', '-' and 'X' in the last iTunes is just laughable).  It is a huge fiasco in my opinion and you shouldn't care too much: OS X users are used to have crazy interface." CreationDate="2010-11-02T20:18:14.130" UserId="257356" />
