It just means you have to design it IO to be on the outside.  This is usually easy to do -- and it causes you to model your objects mathematically instead of operationally.  In your example, just have your business-logic functions take the core data as a parameter (they do *depend on* the core data, right? -- that makes them functions)."

So what @Joris and I have done is fit the spline, *then* predict from this spline at a set of new locations spread over the range of `time`.

  <row Id="6204860" PostId="5472638" Score="0" Text="@Sheldon: that's right. When you open a file in a text editor, then it will have to do some conversion as well. Usually this conversion happens automatically, which can go in two ways: the editor might *always* use the default encoding in the platform (which works just fine as long as it opens only files that are written using the same encoding) or it might try to auto-detect the encoding (which may work with some encodings and some files, but is a tricky problem that can go wrong easily)."
