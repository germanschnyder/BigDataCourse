I wrote my own JSON-based Ajax-implementation for fun and learning, and I don't think it was a &quot;bad idea&quot; at all. To the contrary, I've found use for several ideas from this experience later. (I should add though that my implementation is quite limited and only supports serialization, not deserialization. But it's VERY fast - the JsonSerializer class internally uses a JsonSerializerFactory class, which uses reflection to generate an implementation of IJsonSerializer the first time a type is serialized, then caches the implementation and reuses it.
