Now while this represents a dynamically allocated (at runtime), the size of the array still has to be a compile time constant, as all but the first dimension in the `new []` must be compile time constants.

Since Flash runs client-side you'll need some kind of server-side gateway between it and the database.  However, since the gateway is just an API and doesn't need a UI, an aspx page is overhead you don't need.  An MVC action would do the job, as would a handler which manually returns data (such as in JSON format).  Possibly even an asmx web service, if Flash can communicate with it via SOAP.

Since 10 mod 3 == 1, taking this value mod 3 gives you sum a_i (1^i) = sum a_i.  So if you sum up the digits and it comes up with a multiple of three, the number itself must be a multiple of three.  An even cooler case is if you consider multiples of 11.  Since 10 == -1 (mod 11), your sum ends up coming out to sum a_i (-1)^i, which is the alternating sum of the digits.
