It says: ***Do not be clever** when defining operator overloads. Operator overloading is useful in cases where it is immediately obvious what the result of the operation will be. For example, it makes sense to be able to subtract one DateTime object from another DateTime object and get a TimeSpan object. However, it is **not** appropriate to use the logical union operator to union two database queries, **or to use the shift operator to write to a stream**.* (emphasis mine)" CreationDate="2011-04-01T07:15:43.287" UserId="541686" />

Now, imagine a trait `Foo[M[_]]` - here, you can parameterize Foo with any type constructor of one argument (kind `* -&gt; *`), so for example you could create a `Foo[List]` or `Foo[Option]`, but not a `Foo[List[Int]]` since `List[Int]` has the wrong kind.
