To address performance, it is likely better to attach one event handler to the table that checks the parents of `event.target` than to immediately perform a `.each()` over 100 inputs binding 'click'.  Using the context parameter ensures you only catch bubbling events under the table, so other clicks don't count - and the per click cost to check `$(event.target).closest(selector)` is a minimal (usually &lt;1ms) per click performance loss to gain performance on the document load.
