First off, there's no such thing as &quot;pages&quot; in the standard and not all implementations will work the way you're claiming they do in that regard.  Second of all, you can only overwrite the stack (on systems that even use one) when the array is located on it.  Memory allocated from the free-store is not on the stack.  The kind of attack you're talking about happens when you do something like `void f() { char buf[SZ]; gets(buf); }`, which isn't the OP's issue."

Without this compile-time mechanism, the user code would have to explicitly provide all the types before providing the method pointer, leading to an unusable, clumsy syntax. C++ standard 9.4/2 explicitly allows static functions to be called on objects, which links the two different steps. This allows for a simple macro to be used, giving a natural syntax. The compiler was able to optimize away the deduction and wrapper functions, probably because this all happens at compile time." CreationDate="2010-12-01T06:14:20.480" UserId="308661" />
