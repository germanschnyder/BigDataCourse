If a single value changes in a struct, just create a complete new struct. e.g.: A point is a struct. And you cannot change the X or Y of a Point. Because points are &quot;static&quot; entities, you cannot &quot;move&quot; them. If a Point changes, it has to be another Point, i.e. a new Struct. Conclusion: Make all Properties readonly and pass values only by constructor." CreationDate="2010-09-06T08:55:06.137" UserId="400223" />

A Singleton only ensures that a specific class can only be instantiated once. That's all. This wasn't asked for by the OP. The Singleton being available everywhere is solely due to it being accessed *statically* through the `getInstance()` method. But - if you are not using namespaces - doing `MyClass::foo()` is no different from using a regular function, e.g. `myclass_foo()`, because a static invocation is a call to the global namespace then, with the same risk of clashing."

Unfortunately, we're not packaging pitchfork.jar up with the application - as per the instructions at http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/E12839_01/web.1111/e14453/enable_spring.htm we've put it on the weblogic classpath, so I don't think setting the &lt;prefer-application-packages&gt; would help. Furthermore, we downloaded pitchfork.jar via the link on the oracle site, so I'm suprised it doesn't play nicely with interfaces weblogic wants to use.
