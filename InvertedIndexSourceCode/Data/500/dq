  <row Id="1302162" PostId="1452474" Score="0" Text="@Stephen C  One of the main reasons AFAIK is to eliminate/unify swingx filtering/sorting with java 6 filtering/sorting. It causes a lot of confusion since JXTable/etc inherit from swing classes but the swing sorting/filtering does not work on the swingx classes. W/o this fundamental API change, swingx might still be targeting 1.5." CreationDate="2009-09-21T14:16:15.950" UserId="86515" />
