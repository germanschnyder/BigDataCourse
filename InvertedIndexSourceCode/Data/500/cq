  <row Id="958398" PostId="1138348" Score="0" Text="@Sed, I tried it with a flag - worked fine. The problem actually comes from the event bubbling. When you &quot;leave&quot; the &lt;select&gt; element this triggers an event that &quot;bubbles&quot; through the parent elements. So simply adding stopPropagation() to the 'mouseout' function for the &lt;select&gt; element fixes the problem. Apparently, there are some other issues like the fact that this doesn't quote work all the time, but I will spend more time on it tomorrow. 'setTimeout' will probably be the key when fighting around with IE. Thank you Seb for the help though!" CreationDate="2009-07-16T22:13:28.300" UserId="81314" />
