All properties are is a nice way of calling a method so `@property(assign) int x` can be called as `myClass.x` and `[myClass x]` and it can be set by `myClass.x = 10` and `[myClass setX:10]`. As for accessing @private,@public,@package,@protected variables you do so using `-&gt;`. Ex. `myClass-&gt;_x = 10`" CreationDate="2011-01-28T15:54:15.387" UserId="418715" />
