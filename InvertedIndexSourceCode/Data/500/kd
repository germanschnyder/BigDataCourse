In my case, I want the capabilities that are included with the PagedCollectionView (grouping, sorting, filtering, paging) so I think I'm better off wrapping the &quot;context.Entity1s&quot; EntitySet in a PCV like this:  _pagedCollectionView = new PagedCollectionView(_context.Entity1s);  Then perform adds/deletes directly to the EntitySet.  Also, the PCV automatically refreshes when the EntitySet changes so I don't have to sync." CreationDate="2010-07-16T20:38:46.797" UserId="296059" />
