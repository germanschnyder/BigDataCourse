I'm not meaning it has to be reference or value types, but I think value types are more common when it comes to defining the actual object. It's more about behavior.

To get the `Salary` an `ISalaryCalculator` is used, and what I state is that the `EmployeeName` is &quot;defining&quot; the object but it also depend on some `ISalaryCalculator` through `Salary`, but that doesn't define the object."
