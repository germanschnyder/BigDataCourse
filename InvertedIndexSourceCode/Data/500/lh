The checking that is done at that level of the code makes it impossible to do what you are asking.  There is an explicit check for the # of args passed to an inclusion tag, since that check can't divine what you do with a *args, it is impossible to do with inclusion tags.  If that check were not there, or could be switched off, you would be good to go.  I happened to be debugging in that area is the only reason that I knew it was impossible."

Then one would get all the types from the second table and issue one query/table to get the first n with the highest score for each type." CreationDate="2010-08-25T09:12:17.753" UserId="332324" />

With workflows with a lot of branches, you usually want it set to matching, so that you can push all your branches at once. `current` really is not that useful; once you've pushed it once, it'll obviously be included in `matching`, so you can push it the first time with `git push origin foo`, then just use `git push` from then on."
