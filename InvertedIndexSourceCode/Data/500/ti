DX implements color components as floats (0.0-1.0).  When converting a float value back to 8-bit bytes for final display on the screen, there can easily be a 1-bit rounding difference.  Using floats to interpolate is much more precise than interpolating with bytes, but it all depends on which way the rounding goes.  E.g., the standard banker's rounding will round 0.5 up if even and down if odd (or vice versa).  Bytes interpolation (GDI) always rounds in the same direction."
