For it to be comparable the wait needs to be outside the lock. And 5ms is still 'forever', even 1ms is." CreationDate="2011-01-24T19:03:05.747" UserId="189516" />

Also adding to the difficulty was the fact that viewForHeaderInSection seems to be called multiple times for each given section and it was not always in order. I began to think the problem lied in my backing Data Source, which was an Array of Categories, which each have a single Recipe and multiple Ingredients properties - maybe that's not the best approach.
