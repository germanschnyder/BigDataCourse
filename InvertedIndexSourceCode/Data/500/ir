The answer to the question 'how can I take advantage of Object Oriented benefits like Polymorphism' is switch to an Object Oriented design domain.  Adapt your VOs up front into working business objects.  Is that the right answer for you?  Maybe not.  Zealotry aside, sometimes a procedural pattern is the right answer to a problem.  What's wrong with instanceof?  it's a procedural design pattern, not an OO one, so who cares about an OO principle like polymorphism?  (and &quot;It's slow&quot; hasn't been true for many JVM versions now.)" CreationDate="2010-05-20T19:05:38.913" UserId="331052" />
