There is something I don't understand in the answer. `So you will have to calculate about 750*ceil(log(N))`. Is it not `100*750^2*log^2(N)`? Note that in your code first you take each color and then each element which results in `100*750`. Additionally, when N is divided into 2 parts at step i, the number of different block lengths will be `i * 750` (for i &gt;= 1) (for the first step [ i = 0 ] there is only one state - N), hence `log^2(N) * 750`. Overally this results in `100 * 750^2 * 60^2 ~ 200 * 10^9` (which is not enough to pass 1 max test)" CreationDate="2010-10-30T09:14:04.597" UserId="434460" />

And so is `f().a`. You can call member functions on rvalues. So can, for example, assign to `f()`. One apparent inconsistency arising from that is that if `f` has result type `struct X { int foo; };`, then you can assign to `f()` (the whole structure) due to the implicit assignment member function, but you can't assign to `f().foo`, because that would use the built-in assignment operator on an rvalue. :-) Cheers &amp; hth.," CreationDate="2010-10-30T10:50:32.547" UserId="464581" />
