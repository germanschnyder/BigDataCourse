You'd have to convert the Number to some primitive type to do arithmetic on it. So you'd either have to convert it to a int, long, float or double. So the fact that the parameter was a Number did not gain you anything. You still are using some primitive form to do the math. You might as well show that primitive type in the parameter list and have clients cast to the type on method call." CreationDate="2011-04-26T02:29:16.697" UserId="100565" />

The reasoning behind this is to be able to add extra functionality that otherwise doesn't belong in the domain class, or better yet, when you don't have any domain classes like I have. For example, implementing the INotifyPropertyChanged interface is in my case (without domain model) not easy to do. I guess you could do it by extending the entity class, perhaps, but I do no know the works with it. But then there is as well the question of keeping everything in its own layer. I guess the View and its ViewModel are what is the presentation layer" CreationDate="2011-04-26T14:46:59.920" UserId="712383" />
