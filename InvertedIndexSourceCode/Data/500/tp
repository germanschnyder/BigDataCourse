It shows using a Saxon wrapper around a JDOM document before passing it to a Transformer. Could this be where I'm going wrong? Currently I'm only using the home edition so am just supplying the Transformer with an unwrapped JDOM document.The transformation still happens but the xsl output instructions including the omit-xml-declaration = &quot;yes&quot; and use-character-maps=&quot;iso8879&quot; seem to be ignored."

A private getter (that supposedly returns an instance of the third-party type) defeats the purpose of the incomplete type. Why not simply have the type defined in the header and make it complete, then? Or, why should I have a private type at all; why not use the third-party type directly?"
