So, while you hit the breakpoint, you may still have no idea how you got there. This behaviour is likely to be compiler-dependent, so you may get lucky, but I wouldn't bet on it. Also, you'll hit the breakpoint if your function throws an exception, which may be useful to you as well." CreationDate="2009-08-24T08:41:21.510" UserId="1737" />

Just some outlines: when you search for all categories a child belongs to, you need to issue this query: `SELECT * FROM sets WHERE lft &lt;= @myid and rgt &gt;= @myid`. No single index can serve this query. You will need an `INDEX MERGE` on two indexes which will need to filter possibly thousands of records and then join them. And trees with `100,000` categories are common. `Adjacency list`, on the other side, requires at most as many index lookups as is the depth of the item, which is rarely more than `10`."
