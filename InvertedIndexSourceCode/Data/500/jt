Since you've accepted this answer, there is no need for a session, *per se*. Instead, *the connection is the session*. The client doesn't need to be told anything by the server because as long as the client maintains the open connection, it already has everything it needs. The server also continues to know about the connection, so within your Indy event handlers, you will automatically be given the correct context object for whatever connection the event occurred on."
