However, `x==y` is not in any way related to `std::less`. The equivalence relation induced by `less`, let's call it `equiv` (that's how it is called in 25.3) is defined as `equiv(x, y) = !less(a, b) &amp;&amp; !less(b, a)`. It is a different beast than `==`. The two relations are not consistent and my whole point is that the standard does not require them to be (which is an oversight AFAIC)."

In fact, it's a workaround used for such cases, but basically when you select the parents and the children (ordered and filtered), EF constructs the query exactly the way you want it. It's just that you can't achieve this by cleaner C# code (`Include` will not allow you to order the child collections, so you do the whole thing via projections). Note that I don't use `Include` at all, and yet the `Parents` in the resulting collection have the `Children` collections loaded.
