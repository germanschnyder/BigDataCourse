Ignoring the manual rotation for the moment, I've noticed that if I re-orient the iPhone left or right that iPhone OS (because of resizing masks presumably) stretches the old 320 width to the new 480 width and then stretches the UIWebView downwards proportionately.  And, this is key, if I then touch the UIWebView and pull it upwards the remainder comes into view *and* stays in view when I untouch it.  So by default, it's doing exactly what I want -- I can manipulate any part of the UIWebView onto the screen and have it stay visible.  I just don't know how it's doing it."

So when the compiler was preprocessing the first includes in Pieza.hpp, it ended up again in Pieza.hpp, before being able to define class Pieza, so Jugador could never inherit from it.
