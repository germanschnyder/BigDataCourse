More annoyingly, if you're calloc'ing space from a flash device, calloc will zero all of your memory and then you'd have to go back and erase those blocks.

When user approves an invitation in the web browser i can create my domain object in the service layer having been got it by ID fro repo. Then i can set it approved and pass as a domain object back to repo where it will be re-converted to the linq2sql entity and updated in a DB. But don't you think it would be easier and lighter for the system just to pass ID and a value without any conversations from linq2sql to object model and back?
