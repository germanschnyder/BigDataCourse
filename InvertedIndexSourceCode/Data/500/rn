Yes, in the meantime I've changed the discriminator to a numeric type, similar to the example in your Blog post, in my case: `... .HasValue((byte)0)` which creates a `tinyint` column in the DB. Unfortunately I'm facing now other problems with TPH. One is the `Nullable Column Problem` that you describe. I understand that EF/TPH must make properties nullable if they are in derived types. The strange thing is that even properties in the base class are forced to be nullable. I cannot see why this must be, but The `Required()` method in the Fluent API is silently ignored."

So for a simple 3-argument Runnable that's at least 8 more lines of code. The anonymous inner class syntax is already pretty verbose compared to a proper lambda expression syntax: a single method class has 4 lines of boilerplate you wouldn't need with lambda expressions. So a 3-parameter 1-line lambda expression in Java becomes 13 lines of code. How big would it have to be for you to consider it &quot;that verbose&quot;?"

In my above code just replace `killpg` by `kill` and you will see after 5 secs the parent dies and the child is inherited by init process. Do ps -a at that time. &#xA;Also another thing that I am doing wrong is `killpg(getpid(),SIGTERM);` but since the pgid and pid of the parent process is same it works here. Also the child process has the same pgid. it should have been `killpg(getpgid(getpid()),SIGTERM);`&#xA;&#xA;when BASH forks and execs a child process it changes it `pgid` and makes that equal to its `pid` so that even if the child does killpg bash remains safe."
