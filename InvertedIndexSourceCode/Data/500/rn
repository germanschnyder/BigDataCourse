However, I don't think ordinary integer comparison will work, due to the sign issue. For example, an instance with value 0x00000001 and eps is 0xFFFFFFFF (-1) will compare as _greater_ than an instance with value 0x00000001 and eps 0x00000001 (1). Unfortunately, I couldn't find any comparison intrinsics that looked particularly helpful." CreationDate="2011-02-19T16:31:06.180" UserId="624415" />

Yes, in the meantime I've changed the discriminator to a numeric type, similar to the example in your Blog post, in my case: `... .HasValue((byte)0)` which creates a `tinyint` column in the DB. Unfortunately I'm facing now other problems with TPH. One is the `Nullable Column Problem` that you describe. I understand that EF/TPH must make properties nullable if they are in derived types. The strange thing is that even properties in the base class are forced to be nullable. I cannot see why this must be, but The `Required()` method in the Fluent API is silently ignored."

So for a simple 3-argument Runnable that's at least 8 more lines of code. The anonymous inner class syntax is already pretty verbose compared to a proper lambda expression syntax: a single method class has 4 lines of boilerplate you wouldn't need with lambda expressions. So a 3-parameter 1-line lambda expression in Java becomes 13 lines of code. How big would it have to be for you to consider it &quot;that verbose&quot;?"
