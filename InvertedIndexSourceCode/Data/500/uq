Further to your comment on your question, each image is indeed a separate HTTP request, because each HTTP request can only be made to one address, i.e. the address of each image. The only way to avoid that is to schmush all your images together into one image file on the server, then use that file as the background image on a fixed-size HTML element, and use background positioning to show the correct part of the image file.
