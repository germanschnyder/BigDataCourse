The issue is almost resolved now.when I try wot visit the site entering the following URL &quot;www.misspassiton.com.au&quot;, I see that error/warning message and when I try the following &quot;misspassiton.com.au&quot; the page loads fine on Chrome/Firefox/IE. But I am a little stuck in another issue when I am using IE, I can not access public_html file of wordpress blog on my FTP. If I try to access an image from a public url, it works fine on firefox but shows a cross on IE. I would be obliged if you can throw some light on this issue as well."
