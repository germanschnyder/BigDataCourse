It all depends on whether or not operator overloading is in effect for that particular expressions and whether or not the return type of the `operator++(/*which one?*/)` is an lvalue.  Remember that the overloaded operator could return whatever it likes, even if it wouldn't make sense in the 'classic' use of the operator. Usually that would be a bad, bad thing to do.  But take a look at `operator&lt;&lt;()` for streams - it returns an lvalue where the built-in operator `&lt;&lt;` returns an rvalue." CreationDate="2009-10-02T21:07:04.870" UserId="12711" />

Using `-count` will tell you how many objects are in the array, and you can multiply by the size of a pointer to get a rough estimate, but the array can use much more space (particularly a mutable array) so this can turn out to be a lowball guess anyway. Depending on what your goal is, it may or may not be more helpful than summing the sizes of the instances it holds. In general, I agree with @cobbal that multiple ownership complicates things and makes it less important to know exact sizes.

You're actually recommending a variation on the first normal form." CreationDate="2009-10-06T02:23:38.573" UserId="179930" />
