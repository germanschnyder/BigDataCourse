The .NET runtime makes it extremely cheap to allocate a new object (cost is of a similar order to pointer addition), and you only pay a garbage collection cost for objects that exist at collection time; momentary boxing is *almost* free. Even if the overhead was as high as 1 microsecond (2000-3000 clock cycles, depending on processor speed) per box, a million would only add 1 second of overhead.

I should expand on that, but my intent is to calculate the probability he did (and you have as O in your first equation), then multiply that number by the total count of permutations. So, you'd take O (exactly as you have it, I agree completely), then multiply by 360. In the case of ten wins, 0 losses, and 0 ties, there is exactly one permutation, so you'd multiply by one (10!/(10!*0!*0!) = 1)." CreationDate="2010-10-03T03:35:31.503" UserId="454638" />
