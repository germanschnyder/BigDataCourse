But ideally you'd also like the function `g(x) = 0^x` to be continuous everywhere (just like `e^x` is), in which case it should be 0. Clearly it can't be both (and the 2-valued function `h(x,y) = x^y` must have a discontinuity), so the fix is to leave it undefined, and if you want to discuss a function that's the continuous extension of either f or g, you have to be explicit."
