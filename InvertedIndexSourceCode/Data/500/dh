What makes me wary of the first method is that the syntax is often ambiguous and C++ resolves such ambiguities in favour of function declarations. E.g. consider `int x(int())` which declares a function `x` with return value `int`, taking a single parameter of type “function with return value `int`”. Of course, nobody would write such a contrived declaration but similar cases abound, e.g. when constructing a `string` from `istreambuf_iterator`s to read a whole file into it."

(I'm thinkig I need to set a timer and periodically call canBecomeFirstResponder, but I also wonder if that might be overkill.) What I'd _really_ like to do is detect a shake throughout the app's lifetime, and then send out a notification. Then I can have _any_ part of my app get word of the shake and opt to do something about it. Contrived Example: A table VC could use it as a cue to reload the table."
