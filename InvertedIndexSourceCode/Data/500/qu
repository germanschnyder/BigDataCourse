First, the `x = 0` line in `AbSum()` isn't necessary; x is defined in the `for` statement. Second, rather than using a local `AbSum` variable to store the result of `if i - x in Abundant[:i]:`, you can (in python) use an `else` statement at the end of the `for` loop, which is executed at the end of the loop _only_ if `break` wasn't called -- i.e. only if no match was found."

Depending on how these classes are consumed, using generics in one interface can sometimes create a chain reaction that forces you to genericize multiple classes, which can be burdensome.

In Scheme, you have to write `(define (action kind) (lambda (a) (lambda (b) (kind a b))))` and then `(((action +) 3) 4)`, which is really bulky.  In Haskell, on the other hand, you write simply `action kind a b = kind a b`, and then `action (+) 3 4`; the former is implicitly equivalent to `action = \kind -&gt; \a -&gt; \b -&gt; kind a b` (where `\x -&gt; y` is `(lambda (x) y)`), and the latter is parsed as `((action (+)) 3) 4`.
