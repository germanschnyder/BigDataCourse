Say, when you do `object a = 5`, that `5` is of type `int`, which is a value type, so it lives on the stack. But since you're trying to get a reference of type `object`, which is a reference type, the runtime allocates four bytes on the heap, puts that `5` in there, and then puts reference to those four bytes into variable `a`.
