I'd say, your problem lies somewhere else, maybe in the step beyond parsing. The in the exception message given filename `/Users/admin/IdeaProjects/XMLTest/&lt;` does indeed not look valid btw. Reread the stacktrace, backtrace the right location in the code which caused this based on the line numbers in the trace, nail down the root cause and fix it. If you stucks and this problem is indeed not related to this question, ask a new question (e.g. &quot;How to save a XML file?&quot;)." CreationDate="2010-07-21T19:18:29.047" UserId="157882" />

The performance of the first read IO will be nearly identical (for all practical purposes) between mmap and pread – both have to read it from media. The issue is with subsequent reads. Mmap will use the kernel’s memory eviction LRU algorithm to decide what pages to map out. With Pread will the IO subsystem to decide what blocks to remove from the cache (if any).  Neither approach is highly efficient in terms of releasing unused memory resources.
