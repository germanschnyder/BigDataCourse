A C string is a *pointer to an array of characters*, typically declared as either `char[]` (e.g., `char str[]`) or `char *` (`char *str`). `strcmp` only takes a C string, and does not know how to deal with C strings made of `unichar`s instead of `char`s. Since you have a single `unichar`, you should simply compare it using the equality operator; `strcmp` is only for C strings of `char`." CreationDate="2010-07-04T14:51:53.913" UserId="30461" />

If someone were to put enough effort into it, they might be able to come up with something comparable in performance, but that just typically doesn't happen. When you have a language that's dynamically typed with mechanisms that can only be implemented at runtime like introspection, there is going to be a runtime cost for it and even the best implementers have not been able to make this cost completely negligible.

With RDBMS I can update any number of data sets as a single transaction. With MongoDB if two commits come in that affect multiple data sets, I need a third operation to come back through when they are finished and re-validate the data to ensure it is all correct. And that needs to happen without interruption, e.g. no *other* operations. So in a high-traffic system like we're talking about, relationships could almost always be slightly off."
