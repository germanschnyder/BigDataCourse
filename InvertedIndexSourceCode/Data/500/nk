In those cases where you deliberately want to create a temporary rvalue and bind it, you can use `template&lt;typename U, typename T&gt; U make(T t) { return t; }` and write e.g. `int &amp;i_know_i_want_a_copy = make&lt;int&gt;(42.69);`.  (I.e. we would still allow binding to *existing* temporaries of the correct type, with magical lifetime extension as we currently have for const refs to temporaries.)"
