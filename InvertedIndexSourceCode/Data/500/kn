The reason why i didnt write a vector earlier  is I thought if you have a initialization statement like std::vector&lt;A&gt; temp_array(count), its going to call the default constructor of A count number of times. I didnt have a default constructor for class A  but only a parameterized one. So thought of using a malloc. Later on when I changed it to vector after taking suggestions , the code worked , which is again confusing because my class A doesnt have a default constructor.

A few points: 1) TStringList has an equals method that behaves exactly as I describe, so there is a precedent in the VCL for this, but perhaps you have a point here 2) The default equals() should satisfy the most commonly required behaviour. For customised behaviour you can use TComparer (which is what I've ended up doing in this case, as the default implementation is useless) 3) Comparing two lists for equality is hardly a specific requirement.

Correct, the problem is how to determine the amount of move in the linear portion, to obtain the cruise speed, and in turn we are back to the accel phase and its final speed (the reciprocal for the decel phase).
