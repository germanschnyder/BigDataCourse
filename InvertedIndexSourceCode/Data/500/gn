What it does is loads your object from some data source (ie: a database) where you define the mapping from fields to columns. This saves you the trouble of having to write SQL yourself. In some cases you can use JavaBean getters/setters but you may not want to expose that information. Specifically, your architecture may not need access to those inner variables, but if you need to serialize that object to data in a way that can be reloaded (and does not use Java Serialization), it may be necessary to access those values."

The destructor case is special of course, but there should rarely if ever be a need to modify the object's memory during destruction, no?  (discounting amateurish destructors that think they need to zero-out the members or some such thing).  But it certainly makes sense that the `const`ness of an object would end at the start of the destructor.  The object is not useable after that point and the memory is about to be freed."

With TortoiseSVN, you get a nice dialog showing non-versioned files as well, so it's easier to see the problem. Also, it's much easier to only commit SOME of your changes, since you can just deselect what you don't want, instead of specifying a complete list of what you want to commit. That's MUCH more user-friendly." CreationDate="2010-02-16T21:02:30.530" UserId="27528" />

But in real life, functions tend to grow when requirements change, and at some point this becomes a necessity because you don't want to spend time trying to figure out why that line of code you just added isn't being executed, then to realise that the function returned many lines above in one conditional branch. That's why." CreationDate="2010-02-17T09:51:34.987" UserId="106979" />
