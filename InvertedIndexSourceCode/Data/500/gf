Although it's costly to make a new copy every time, one can design data structures to take advantage of immutability by sharing structure; for example, if you have linked list A = (3, 2, 1) and list B = (4, 3, 2, 1), and both are immutable, list B can be represented by 4 and then a pointer to the head of A.  The same thing can be done with trees." CreationDate="2010-02-03T19:07:49.023" UserId="55943" />
