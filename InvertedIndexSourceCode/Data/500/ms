Likewise for entities in the business context of the program (e.g. object names): “`Are you sure that you want to move %s to the trash?`”. Perhaps I should have been more explicit (“lexical” was a lousy term to use) but my question basically is: can *these* kinds of texts really make problems? If so, I’d really like to see examples."

You use `exec` to run code in which there's a function declaration, then you call the declared function from your main code after the `exec`. Or you pass the parameter in to the exec block like a kwarg by storing it in a dictionary key. Both of these approaches are a bit awkward in that they rely on a convention of giving the function or variable a particular name. If you want to avoid this, and you know that there's only going to be one function declared in the exec block, you can check the dict's values for a callable instead of looking for a particular key."

Assuming the earth is a perfect sphere (I know it actually isn't), would the angle to distance formula work for any location on earth?
