They are &quot;unchecked&quot; by default, even though it would be just as efficient to use checked operations (once jitted the checked opcodes would become normal arithmetic instructions followed by a jcc with a &quot;probably not taken&quot; branch prediction prefix). You could argue that it would better capture user intent to be &quot;checked by default&quot; (require an explicit declaration that it's OK to overflow).
