I realize the limitation of using only a recruit's first and last names as the primary key, but this database is just for a hobby project (ie, a football video game) so the likelihood of me recruiting two fictional players with the same name is pretty low. I have a question, though: What is the purpose of the `c` after the right parenthesis? Here's the query that I'm using: `SELECT *&#xA;FROM&#xA;(&#xA;	SELECT class&#xA;	FROM recruits WHERE pos IN ('C', 'G', 'T')&#xA;	GROUP BY class&#xA;	ORDER BY class ASC&#xA;	LIMIT 5&#xA;) C`" CreationDate="2011-02-17T17:41:30.410" UserId="576066" />
