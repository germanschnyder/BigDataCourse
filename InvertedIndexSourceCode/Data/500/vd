A list could be implemented on-top of an array, much like a deque can. If this were the case (as it is in C# for example), then every argument for using deque over list would seem moot, no?

It's more than likely that the controller would have translated any query string or form values into .NET types which you would then pass into your helper methods.  The reason that you don't want to create the controller yourself is that in ASP.NET MVC, the controller is usually set up with a `ControllerContext` and just creating a new controller doesn't set up that information correctly.  In creating helper classes, you remove the need for the `ControllerContext`, the controller acts as an adapter between the `ControllerContext` and your logic."

Actually, the only real example I'm coming up with is your own `data-xyz` attributes, which you'd get with `attr` unless you want to use jQuery's `data`, which I avoided initially but may start using as of recent improvements to it. Another advantage of knowing your properties is that you can make your code more efficient. If you've ever written `var link = $(this).attr(&quot;href&quot;)` to get the `href` of an anchor in an event handler, once you know your reflected properties, you'll feel confident writing `var link = this.href` instead."

  <row Id="6770597" PostId="5884190" Score="0" Text="@Stephen - When using two projects, you need to explicitly recompile the project. I'm not quite MVC expert, but I don't think it supports per-page compilation (mainly because there is no concept of &quot;page&quot;). It can just pick changes in the view (Razor) file. But I may be wrong... I liked this too - but apparently, web projects are mostly created as compiled these days (I think), but I don't quite understand why."
