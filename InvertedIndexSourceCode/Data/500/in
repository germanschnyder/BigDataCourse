I think this rule of thumb applies to `StringBuilder` and fluent interfaces just as much as it does to `DateTime`. You don't lose any functionality by treating StringBuilder as if it's immutable."

Think of the way that many children learn how to add: they start with a pile of two gumballs and move three more gumballs into their pile, *modifying their pile* (their variable). It's true that doing so doesn't change the (platonic) number two, but who's arguing that? `DateTime.Add` is misleading because it implies that a date time variable is a pile of gumballs rather than an immutable value.
