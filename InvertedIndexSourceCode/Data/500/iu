Just make sure to reset said variable to False at whatever you consider the &quot;start&quot; of a sequence of tests.  Not all that different from what you're doing but absolutely no `return` involved (and, not an instance attribute, to make sure the attribute persists across tests -- depending on the test runner, you might lack such assurance for instance attributes)."

I guess the idea is that it all depends on the specific situation - in this, the application does not bounds check the allocation of an array, where the array's size is an integer.
