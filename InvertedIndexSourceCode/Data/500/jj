So this code will be accessible from UI via methods. I wonder who shall call these new methods: forms or controls.  Imagine I have user control &quot;login&quot;: 2 textboxes + 1 button. Shall &quot;login&quot; call business logic method on button click or shall &quot;login&quot; have &quot;OnLogin&quot; event and delegate business logic call to form? Nowadays code has mixed approach: sometimes controls but sometimes forms contains business logic" CreationDate="2010-06-17T14:08:01.013" UserId="294642" />

When you create one, you're telling the database where to start searching and how far away to search (which is why a table isn't just a true set; it must have an ordering).
