That said, it's worth thinking twice before using this technique, reserving it for only those scenarios where it actually does pay off: a lot of developers who *haven't* started on a different platform leave themselves open to headaches when they blindly accept that every action must result in a postback."

My guess is that these are enums, and that you use an if or switch statement somewhere in your code to do different things depending on the BoardType field. This is typically the perfect case for a strategy pattern. The strategy is an interface, and you will have one implementation for each enum value. The enum goes away. This pushes the decision making from explicit &quot;if&quot; tests into the land of polymorphism." CreationDate="2009-12-19T05:16:38.877" UserId="120278" />

Defining the same function in multiple files results a linker error which can be countered by declaring the function 'static'. However, 'inline' allows you to do the same thing with subtle differences that they do not actually get internal linkage like 'static' does. I suspect that this is actually more a coincidence because language implementers/designers realized that they'll need to do something special with functions declared in header files and that carried over to 'inline'."
