In the .g.cs file, the path to the .baml file is listed but it has the extension &quot;.xaml&quot;. Application.LoadComponent has some internal logic that replaces the &quot;.xaml&quot; extension with &quot;.baml&quot; before searching the resources in the assembly.

BUT: how do you tell your receiving threads that the client is closing down, and they must leave the `recv` call with an error?  Usually, you simply `closesocket()` on that socket handle, and the call returns error.

It works because you essentially treat each &quot;column&quot; of the bitmask as an &quot;on/off switch&quot; that represents one item (in this example, your inventory).  You define the items such that (in binary) they only have a single 1, with all the rest being 0.  This means you can OR them together and not lose any information.  It's REALLY useful, and you'll see them a LOT in Cocoa (most methods that have an `options:` parameter are asking for a bitmask of options)" CreationDate="2010-08-06T21:05:09.937" UserId="115730" />

In the main loop, you just call game_state() and the correct screen will be shown. You can let the functions themselves adjust the value of game_state, in order to make the program switch screen.

It depends on the existence of said element in the HTML source to which you're applying that CSS.
