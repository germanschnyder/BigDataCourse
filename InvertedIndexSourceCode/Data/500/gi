TDataset is an abstract base class that you don't instantiate directly, and you can send it any TDataset descendant without knowing about the inheritance chain.

Your problem is that the `autoresizingMask` only applies to resizing the view's superview; the mask defines what effect this has on the view. If there is no superview yet, then there is no “centered”, because “centered” refers to the view's placement within its superview. You can't *keep* the view centered, which is what the autoresizing mask does, until the view has a superview for it to be centered *in*.

The practical reality of deployment through CloudFoundry will be that you want a distributed topology and of course S3 for the data.  You will also probably always want to be able to send email from your app and have a payment gateway involved somewhere - after all these are commercial app, not static web pages that we're building.  There is clearly a gap in wrapping up the whole deployment into something easily consumable by engineers and CloudFoundry feels like a good start, but they are still a way off being a complete offering IMO."
