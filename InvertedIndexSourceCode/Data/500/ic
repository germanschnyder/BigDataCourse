Generally you should set it to &quot;StringClob&quot; customtype, because that should mean to NHibernate that it's a 'text' type, but even so some NHibernate database providers (like PostgreSQL) will disregard it. That's why for example in my Override example I have used both the CustomType and the CustomSqlType declaration, to set it to &quot;text&quot;.&#xA;Alternatively if you change the database schema underneath then NHibernate won't really care whether it's varchar or something bigger (text,blob,etc). But this is not a good solution either because of a lot of obvious things." CreationDate="2010-04-26T12:48:11.587" UserId="120917" />

Unless you define hundreds of exception classes, you get two functions that throw the same exception (or perhaps one a subclass of the other). Your function calls both functions, and declares that it throws that exception. Actually you could/should have handled one of those two failure cases there and then. The compiler thinks you meant your caller to handle it, so doesn't complain. Generally in C++ you use exceptions only for catastrophes (Runtime or Error in Java), and fail explicitly."
