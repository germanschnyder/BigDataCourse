Meanwhile I found a workaround for this:&#xA;&#xA;You can embed both versions of DPInst.exe (the ones for x86 and x64) into the msi package and just run those from the MSI, depending on which platform you are, and use silent mode (/q or /si). It is true the size of the MSI file will increase, but at least you can provide a single MSI for all platforms. I see no reason why Microsoft does it this way: supporting multiple platform installation packages for drivers, but no multiple platform MSI files for those drivers."
