There was no need for some fixes or further problems (but i don't know if the trunk version is patching some other libraries. Maybe that could be a problem for someone else)."

The scope block may be similar to plotting `plot([1 2 2 3],[0 0 1 1]);`, whereas the result of SIMPLOT may be similar to plotting `plot([1 2 3],[0 0 1])`. Notice how the first plot replicates point 2 for the x data (with a 0 and 1 for the y data), which makes a vertical line.

The only thing that I am stuck on is that if you run psexec with -d it returns an exit code of the PID that it started.  If you run it without the -d it hangs indefinitely.  Unfortunately TeamCity depends on an exit code of 0 to determine a pass / fail.  Thanks for the tip though, it got the thing to actually run the batch file and that's what I was stuck on."
