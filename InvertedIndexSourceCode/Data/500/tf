But im going to put out there, i dont class this as a valid answer.. just a crazy idea." CreationDate="2011-03-27T12:51:01.417" UserId="359347" />

Both our functions can be `Compiled`, and so are fast. But if you define the same function with patterns and try using it in Map, you immediately have an order of magnitude slowdown on packed lists.
