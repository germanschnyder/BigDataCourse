Mathematically speaking, if an argument to function isn't in the domain of that function, then the result is undefined. Can one say that &quot; 123 &quot; is intrinsically in the domain of all string-to-int functions? I don't believe one can say that. The designer could have thrown a bad-argument exception in that case. Instead they chose to broaden the domain to include such arguments. That's what I mean by 'contingent'. My argument is that because of that contingency, an explicit `strip` is not redundant." CreationDate="2010-03-25T01:53:49.517" UserId="60620" />

There isn't an existing end-to-end solution for this.  You need to build it yourself, the glue is probably SOAP.
