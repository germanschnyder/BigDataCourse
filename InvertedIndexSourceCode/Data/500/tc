The actual files are auto generated by the batch-system; it's aborted/deleted today, maybe something else tomorrow (depends on the JobStatus). I don't think this is the way it should be done.

On another line, send a `copy` message to the number instance, and store the return value in a second variable. 3. Call `NSLog` to print the addresses stored in the two variables.
