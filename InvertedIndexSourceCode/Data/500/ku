But rather than bind each column to a property, you bind it to the `RowData[&quot;ColumnName&quot;]` property/indexer on the ViewModel representing the row.  The advantage with this approach is you can use another binding/property path to specify the column name.  As for binding the column collection, I am referring to the Columns property on a normal grid - think Infragistics might call them Fields.  Does that help?"

With tag files you can do everything you could do in a jsp include, from small snippets to whole page fragments.
