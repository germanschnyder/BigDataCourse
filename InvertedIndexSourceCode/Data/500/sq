A salt is used to make finding the preimage for a hashed password harder. An IV is used to ensure various security properties on a cipher, including that the same message encrypted twice will not result in the same ciphertext. What you want here is an IV, which should be unique for every single message you create. You don't need a salt, because you can't store the password as a hash."
