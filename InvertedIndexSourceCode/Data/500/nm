The reason is that positioning of elements can only happen on integer pixel values. When animation happens over a long time, the intermittent positioning changes get smaller than 1 pixel, so the picture, instead of moving diagonally, moves one up, one right, one up, one right. It's basically the effect that anti-aliasing tries to remedy in computer graphics.
