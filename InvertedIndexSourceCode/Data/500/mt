Java is strict, and this strictness allows the JVM to be written more easily. If you need a CVM, you'd need to either enforce standards on C, in which case it won't be C anymore, or writing the CVM would be extremely difficult as compared to writing JVM because it would have to handle way too many cases.

However, if you want to use native API, you can try MySQLi driver, which also supports prepared statements almost same way as PDO. MySQL supports prepared statements well, as I know, and it helps to achive more perfomance, if you need to do same queries several times. Based on my post: $stmt-&gt;execute(array('John', '444')); $stmt-&gt;execute(array('Bill', '777')). As I know it should be faster than traditional mysql_query. Also prepared statements are more convinient, because, in general, you don't need to do sanitization of parameters before insertion." CreationDate="2010-10-14T05:44:25.827" UserId="475061" />
