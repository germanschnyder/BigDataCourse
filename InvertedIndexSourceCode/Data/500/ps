Ideally, I think the OP would like a function template which works with *any* type, and just deduces the correct return type (as done trivially with `decltype` in C++0x). So overloading isn't really a good solution as it only works for a bounded set of types (and you have to write a number of overloads, instead of a single general version). Of course overloading is generally preferable to template specialization, but specialization isn't really called for here anyway, I think." CreationDate="2011-01-09T20:38:27.250" UserId="33213" />

Many folks use &quot;heap&quot; in the sense of abstract data structures; others need to draw a linguistic distinction between the areas of memory managed by `new`/`delete` and `malloc`/`free`, respectively. Had `new`/`delete` been designed first, perhaps the purists would be using &quot;free store&quot; to refer to `malloc`'s memory pool, while others would still be using &quot;heap&quot; to refer to either (unless the context requires a distinction.)"
