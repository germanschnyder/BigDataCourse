My initial thinking was that Task commits you to a particular implementation, while Lazy is generic enough to hide away those details, making it suitable for any sort of future value. In practice, Lazy turns out to be a very thin layer over Task, so it doesn't buy much. Worse, it blocks you from using Task-oriented things, such as ContinueWith. Anyhow, I'll post the code now, just to show *how* it can be done, not that it should." CreationDate="2010-09-28T15:39:10.660" UserId="131926" />

I notice that @Sander advocates doing the bug fixes in trunk and merging them into the relevant production branch.  This works fine also so long as the fix works exactly the same both places, but in real situations, I have found that I need to fix the production code first, then make sure the fix works in trunk.  So, I would implement my fix on the production branch, then merge to trunk.  Just my preference, though." CreationDate="2010-09-28T18:52:17.547" UserId="239394" />
