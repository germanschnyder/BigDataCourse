Actually, i understand this use-case of &quot;transforming&quot; a Java SE application to a &quot;cluster application&quot;. Terracotta really makes sense in this case! But my question was: Does it make sense to combine Terracotta with JEE application servers. In my opinion, these application servers already offer the same feature (e.g. WebSphere Application Server cluster), i.e. you deploy one application to several clusters, but still develop a single non-clustered application...

My question is what are the values ​​that I have to put to transmit the webcam or screen stream. For example, to transmit video in MPEG format, the value of &quot;m&quot; parameter is: m=video 3000 RTP/AVP 32. One question that I want someone to answer is whether the same parameter &quot;m&quot;, should have a different value when transmitting the webcam stream?"
