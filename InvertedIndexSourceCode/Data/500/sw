So the multiple options can be simply accessed by doing `indexOriginal(repeatIndices)=tiePerms(i,:)`, where `tiePerms` is the output of `perms` from above and `i` is the permutation that you want. Extending this to sets of duplicates is also straightforward, by checking to see how many elements in `B` are greater than 1. `sum(B&gt;1)` should tell you how many sets."

What Null Set is proposing is building a heap that contains only `k` elements: it includes the first (minimal) element from each sorted array. Just one element from each array. When you remove the minimum element from the heap (and send it to output), you add the next element from the same array to the heap and rebuild the heap. This way the size of the heap is always only `k`." CreationDate="2011-03-21T07:15:50.570" UserId="187690" />
