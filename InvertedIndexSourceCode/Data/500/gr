I am using one document as query and 2nd as target. Thats the reason I am calculating tf*idf for target separately and tf*idf for query. I can not use transponse coz i don't know exactly what columns and rows number would be. This is just an example :) in question. Can you please explain little more how can I solve my problem? Should I create one tf*idf for both query and target? if yes then how will I calculate cosine?" CreationDate="2010-02-23T04:12:18.000" UserId="238384" />

When you say `(symbol? s)`, `s` gets evaluated (in this case to `1`) before the `symbol?` function sees it, so you're basically asking if `1` is a symbol (which it isn't). If you quote the symbol, it gets passed to `symbol?` unchanged. (`eval` operates on data structures, so the symbol in-memory representation will in both cases have already been constructed by the reader; the quoting makes `eval` leave it unevaluated).

If the driver for what and when you refactor is purely motivated by duplication of code, the repeated code chunk may not map to a nice abstract concept.  If you have to locate and examine the code to understand how it affects the calling function, you've added complexity instead of removing it.  Duplication by itself isn't reason enough to pull out a chunk of code.  Duplication plus a nice concept to wrap it in is." CreationDate="2010-02-23T20:17:16.833" UserId="139794" />
