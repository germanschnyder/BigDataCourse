I understand the point about everything being displayed in 8 bit but then, how do I accurately display a 32 bit image in 8 bit or even 16 bits? An approach that I was taking previously was simply to divide the entire image by 0xFFFF. This brought a 32 bit image in 16 bit range and I was able to display without clipping. However, there were always some differences in brightness if I had previously saved the file as 16 bits. What is the best approach to this - how can I deal with both 16 bit and 32 bit images?"
