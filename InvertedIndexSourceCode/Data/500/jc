Also, note that flipping the sign changes the problem in as much that the Assumption should read x0&lt;0 now for the problem to be equivalent. This of course brings back the original problem :-(."

I suspect that somehow the SYS user doesn't have execute rights on DBMS_ASSERT and that's why the DBMS_ASSERT call from DBMS_AQADM fails.  DBMS_AQADM is a &quot;definer rights&quot; package and thus executes with the rights of its definer which in this case in the SYS user.  DBMS_ASSERT is an &quot;invoker rights&quot; package and executes with the rights of the caller.

We are using Oracle Coherence on the back end and there is no big difference from performance side between selecting all fields and set of fields. &#xA;&#xA;But we'll have very big number of different rest resources (services)  and we need some common rules.&#xA;&#xA;We rather thinking about something more useful and elegant from service client perspective, the point is that on a top of core rest api several web sites will be created by several different development teams. So we need something convenient and intuitive." CreationDate="2010-06-08T14:17:05.450" UserId="306025" />
