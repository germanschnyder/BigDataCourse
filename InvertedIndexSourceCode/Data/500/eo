Those buttons-with-options that MS uses sometimes in file open dialogs (does this control have a commonly used name?) seem like a neat idea, but from a usability perspective they don't work well. At least for me. While there's the little down-arrow indicator on the button, it still strikes me as non-discoverable since that indicator is effectively invisible. I never notice them, and from the questions I've seen where the answer is 'use that little down arrow on the button', I'm not the only one." CreationDate="2009-11-12T19:18:07.583" UserId="12711" />

Now just to write an interceptor that grabs the message, interrogates the WCF mehtod to figure out what type was expected, deserialize using XmlSerializer (which according to the thread does work), and re-serialize using DataContractSerializer. How simple ;)  Still... probably the only solution that would actually work as expected. Thanks :)" CreationDate="2009-11-13T09:47:16.273" UserId="111013" />

I mean that you want to be able to wrap any, say, List implementation and change particular method behavior/add new method(s). Is that right?"
