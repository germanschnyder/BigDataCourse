Secondly, it is a matter of definitions (i.e. &quot;subjective and argumentative&quot;). Finally, it is stupid. sinc(x) = sin(x) / x can be defined to be equal to unity at the origin, because it makes sense.  lim sin(x)/x = 1 as x -&gt; 0. But lim x/y does not exist as (x, y) -&gt; (0, 0). You get 1 if x = y, 0 if x = 0, and the limit diverges if y tends to zero faster than x." CreationDate="2010-07-13T18:33:31.223" UserId="282848" />

So let's take your example. If you have 3 players, then I'm guessing one of them picks his chips first, right? If the first one picks `8/1/0`, then the second one is left to pick from `10 - 8 = 2 reds, 10 - 1 = 9 greens, 10 - 0 = 10 blues`. After the second one picks, the possibilities are again reduced for the third. So I would think you just subtract the choice of each player then rerun the same algorithm.
