Back to THIS question, (regarding stylesheets), as I mentioned, I tried EVERYTHING mentioned in the documentation (which by the way contradicts itself) - In one doc (both related to the 1.4 version) it recommends to use view.yml and include_stylesheets() and in another it recommends use_stylesheet() - I'm suprised no one has spotted this. Anyway, I tried both methods (yes, and cleared the cache too) - NONE WORKED. I then tried $sf_response-&gt;addStyleSheet()" CreationDate="2010-01-20T10:59:07.747" UserId="205040" />
