If you only used this top layer from your GUI it would prevent EDT blocking and avoid your GUI from having to deal with the messy property state checking and merging process.

The problem I have with &quot;only measuring tells the truth&quot; is: it's to late: fixing a design bug in a profilable application is expensive, keeping in mind the *possibility* of a custom allocator for key objects often costs close to nothing. Also, Knuth's often quoted as an excuse to completely ignore performance until the product is in beta. Fortunately, our computers are fast enough to make that a non-issue most of the time."
