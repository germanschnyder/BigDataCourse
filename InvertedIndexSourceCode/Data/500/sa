I use async queues that then spawn a thread. You queue items, the queue starts a worker thread that would then invoke (itself) into the UI and pull items from the queue as needed. Every x items, or when empty, the thread would deinvoke back, so the UI can refresh. This allows me to handle thigns totally async withou tons of begin invoke calls, which in themselves are slow too (you just hide it at the moment)."
