What I meant is that you can detect '`\n`' inside `&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;` just like other characters. I have the impression that the OP knows quite a bit about RegEx except that he does not know how to match new line and he thought `$` is how to do it. Therefore, my super-quick answer is to tell him that '`\n`' can be used to match newline BUT you have to turn the multiple line regex on." CreationDate="2009-10-22T16:20:48.287" UserId="176180" />
