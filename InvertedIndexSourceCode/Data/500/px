If you have a look at the example on http://railscasts.com/episodes/43-ajax-with-rjs you can see there are a few different parts to it - the rjs, the show view and the controller. When the remote form is submitted it goes to the controller action for the URL - in this case, create. When it hits the create definition in the reviews controller, it will then look for something to feed back to the user - in this case, because no create.html exists, it will use create.rjs. The values from the form you submit will be stored in params. Hopefully that clears up any confusion?" CreationDate="2011-01-13T19:23:23.413" UserId="346232" />

If I implement `Dictionary&lt;Parts, Qty&gt; partsList`, then it it's impossible to express additional attribute like CAR_PARTS (CARID, PARTSID, QUANTITY, FOO).  And about the idea `List&lt;CAR_PARTS&gt; parts`, I've actually considered. But the problem in it is, the difference between the pattern that has additional and not. I'm developing a data access library and it's required lower compatibility. So it's problem to change the design if in the future there appears additional attribute. So I want to know if there is some other good idea." CreationDate="2011-01-14T07:31:47.727" UserId="550971" />
