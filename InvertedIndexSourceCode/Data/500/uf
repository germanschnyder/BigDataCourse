  <row Id="6486222" PostId="5679708" Score="1" Text="@Acme: what @achepler says: my answer does apply to C++ as well, there is nothing in the C++ grammar either to make `{}` valid on its own at file scope. A namespace definition starts with the keyword namespace and optionally a name, so `{}` is valid after that but not on its own. For that matter in C++ `struct foo {};` is valid, but that also doesn't mean `{}` on its own is. In both C and C++, `void foo() {}` is valid - again that doesn't permit just `{}` with no introduction." CreationDate="2011-04-15T18:28:15.980" UserId="13005" />
