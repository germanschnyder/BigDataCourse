If you instead invoke the function by name **with** parentheses, like `var value = foo()` or `func(bar())`, then you are executing the function and the result of the function will be assigned to the variable or passed to the function, respectively."

It seems like MVCC (multi-version-concurrency-control) is the best DB centric solution. It avoids the write lock entirely by allowing the previous version to still be read while the update transaction is open. Thus allowing long running updates."

I've been checking the source of the excel.xlsx file, and Excel is storing the full value because it's actually stored in full as a plaintext value in the worksheet XML file.
