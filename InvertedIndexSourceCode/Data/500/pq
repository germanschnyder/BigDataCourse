As you don't setup any projection or transform matrix, it is certainly that your third point is offscreen. The others may be clipped as well because of the Z value. I don't have the default opengl projection in mind though. You should try to call glOrtho to install a projection. You should also try to draw a triangle, it will make things graphically more obvious if some points are at infinity or outside the screen." CreationDate="2011-01-07T10:51:26.570" UserId="70881" />
