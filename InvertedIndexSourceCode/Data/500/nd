For example, imagine the source is a tcp server, it gets a packet, and calls handleSomething with the contents, the msg handler handles the packet, and when it has enough data from the source to build a logical msg, it send it to the sink. You can imagine similar situations where you read msgs from a file line by line. Doesn't really matter the context. The problem is entirely syntactic. How is this achieved? Is it impossible?

I feel that the else improves the readability of the code, however I will leave it out in future situations if it is an optimization.  I am using decimal due to its exact nature and nicer format options when dealing with currency.  Doing so is recommended by my instructor and textbook.  I am conscious of its cost in memory, it wont need to be cast to other types.  While your edited solution may work if the method is left inside the struct, I have chosen to leave it outside."
