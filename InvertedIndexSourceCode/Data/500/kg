My question is, if there are some pitfalls with it, but probably my question is to unspecific. Thanks for the answer anyway." CreationDate="2010-07-21T18:31:14.220" UserId="340628" />

(perhaps by having a last_move and first_move property in addition to the full list.  that way you could still query to find aggregates that contain moves that fell within a time period, without needing each move in the index indvidiually)."
