If you see on my code, I am getting an xml output through &quot;$xml-&gt;saveXML()&quot; that I saved like &quot;$save=$xml-&gt;saveXML();&quot;. Now I need to give &quot;$xslt-&gt;transformToXML();&quot; an xml parameter, I here used $save but it raises error that it expects an object here, string given. Now I need to know how could I convert the response from   &quot;$xml-&gt;saveXML()&quot; to a form so that it could be used as a parameter for &quot;$xslt-&gt;transformToXML();&quot;.
