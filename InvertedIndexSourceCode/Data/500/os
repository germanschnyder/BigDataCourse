And my question is still valid. It is not `so easy` to code this since one has to take pagination, highlights, border colors, round corner effects etc. into account. And what I am asking is such a common thing that I am sure someone else has done it before. No need to reinvent the wheel." CreationDate="2010-12-10T02:55:05.570" UserId="448625" />

  <row Id="4803679" PostId="4405093" Score="0" Text="@Jon Yeah, that won't work. You'll have to do that in a controller method like `beforeFilter`, at which point the component is already up and running. So you'll have to structure the component to do its job at some later point and pass it the necessary information after it has been initialized. You can simply do `$this-&gt;Foobar-&gt;baz = 42` at any point in the controller, or create a setter method in your component you'll call from the controller. Look at http://book.cakephp.org/view/996/Creating-Components for all the possible callback points a component has." CreationDate="2010-12-10T02:55:45.680" UserId="476" />

This means the memory storage is finite. `sizeof(long)` is finite. This means the addressable content of any given file is finite. The size of strings is limited by `size_t`, so the number of possible filenames/files is finite. Thus, unlike many other languages which may be finite in implementation but formally Turing-complete, C and C++ **formally** describe finite-state machines (mainly due to the &quot;representation of types&quot; as `char`)."
