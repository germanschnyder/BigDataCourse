Your way is based on the deployment of .class files. But in my real situation, the Class B can not extend Class A (in a separated JAR library) because Class A is encrypted.

Also, I don't know how to explain it better. @Alexey noted that `HoldAll` for `f` did not prevent the substitution of `cf` by its value, and I noted that that substitution was happening not when `f[args]` was evaluated (l.h.s), but when `OptionValue` on the r.h.s of the definition for `f` was evaluated. So, my point was that it was a consequence of `OptionValue`'s evaluation and had nothing to do with the `HoldAll` attribute of `f`." CreationDate="2011-05-01T16:41:06.437" UserId="565518" />

It's like getting paid to solve puzzles all day, and every now and then you get something really creative and unexpected.
