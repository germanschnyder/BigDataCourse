When you start a thread (including the main thread), the system reserves a continuous chunk of address space for the stack. The memory gets automatically committed as it is used, but if you hit the limit, you're screwed. There's no place to extend the stack into, as the stack needs to be continuous in memory (i.e. you can't split it to smaller chunks)." CreationDate="2010-08-04T22:11:38.203" UserId="284799" />

Use MVC to develop applications. You can even feed a WCF endpoint into an MVC application if you wish. MVC controller methods can also serve as REST endpoints for XML or JSON; do that if it fits your sensibilities, but unless you're already creating an application alongside, that seems like overkill to me (although I find it trivially easy to do that)."

You should post this comment as an edit to your question - it's elaboration, rather than an answer, and it belongs with your original question.  Regarding your comment, though: it's still possible to generate your context-sensitive changes on the ribbon through pure Xaml and clever use of data templates.  I would advise against doing it in code, since it limits your flexibility and makes the Xaml more tightly-bound to its codebehind (which is something you rarely need to do in WPF)."
