But it is kind of semi-workaround which may or may not work depending on the logic in question. The best thing you can do is to make renaming process just try again and again if rename fails, so it won't be a fatal error. But it works only if you have control over it."

I should have thought of that...lol.&#xA;&#xA;And I suppose I can just create a dict of Workshops, to faciliate quick lookup? However, how do I traverse the hierarchy then? For example, before I could navigate to the first layer to get all Workshops in Week 1, then unwrap the next layer to get all Workshops in Week 1, Stream 1 etc. Is it still possible to do some navigation using classes?"
