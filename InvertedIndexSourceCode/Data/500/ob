Each group of numbers in the IP address string represents a byte. So the IP address `172.24.17.174` is a sequence of these bytes: `172`, `24`, `17`, and `174`. Convert each byte to their hexadecimal form, and you get `0xac`, `0x18`, `0x11`, and `0xae`, respectively. If you put these four bytes together in reverse order, you get `0xae1118ac`.
