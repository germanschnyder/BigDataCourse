When you float an element, the *content* of the next element in the source order will wrap around it, but the next element itself actually extends behind the floated element (so that its content can wrap under the float once the float is finished).

For instance, if you `malloc(1000000000)`, and the system doesn't actually have a contiguous 1GB block, the malloc may end up succeeding anyway. However, it won't actually allocate system resources until you write to your malloc'd blocks, and when it does, it may grind your system to a halt.  The point is, unless you know your target environment won't overcommit memory, you can't rely on malloc() telling the truth.
