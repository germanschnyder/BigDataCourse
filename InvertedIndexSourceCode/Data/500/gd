However, depending on the app, you might want to change your approach a little - you could first save the new data to the server and then from there issue a &quot;modelChanged&quot; type of event (for example with the help of cometd, ape-server or the push module for nginx). What you would gain is that if you have many instances of the app opened in different tabs in the browser, they all get synchronized (useful for stuff like chat, mail, etc clients - it all depends on how your users will use your application)."

On the other hand, one of the big benefits of properties in interface design is the ability to re-factor an auto-property into a full property without changing the interface.

We have an AJAXed website which loads available options dynamically. In certain cases when different options can't be selected, we select one and disable the control. This needs to post back to the server because we need the setting. (Yes, theoretically, we could figure out what the value would be on the backend, but since the logic has already been done, there's no need to complicate things.)"
