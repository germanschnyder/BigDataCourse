The Common Lisp standard does not require this consing (and functions should thus not rely on their rest parameter being freshly consed); I am not sure about the Scheme standard.  Another concern is that the list might be circular.  I guess it boils down to how lambda lists are matched to the supplied arguments.  Anyway, you would normally use a higher order function like `map` or `reduce` whenever you would have such long argument lists." CreationDate="2010-07-14T09:17:48.013" UserId="31615" />
