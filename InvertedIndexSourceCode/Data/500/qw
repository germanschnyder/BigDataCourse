Normally, you do not wish to do that, but sometimes it is reasonable to limit input fields to only decimal digits `\p{Nd}`, or only numbers `\pN`, or only math figures `\p{Math}`, or only letters `\pL`, or only alphabetics `\p{Alphabetic}`, or **most especially** only characters that are all of either one or two scripts or of type Common. That avoids some security pitfalls such as B≢Β≢В (i.e., U+0042 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER B vs U+0392 GREEK CAPITAL LETTER BETA vs U+0412 CYRILLIC CAPITAL LETTER VE). Some are intractable, though."
