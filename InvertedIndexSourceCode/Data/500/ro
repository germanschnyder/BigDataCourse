If thats the case, is there some way to synchronize the constructor in EggCatcherView to wait until setContentView in Eggcatcher has finnished?"

  <row Id="5676503" PostId="5035069" Score="0" Text="Thanks for the input i decided to skip the rails image gems and just handle the uploads manually and use Rmagick. All the libraries lacked at least one feature that I needed and complicated things. What I was looking for is database storage(or at least be able to restrict access to logged in users without needing to write a rack auth system), the ability to mark images as public as well, and the ability to resize on the fly and get image information without needing to create db fields for it. Nothing seemed to fit my criteria, which means more work than rolling my own library on top of Rmagick" CreationDate="2011-02-21T16:12:36.837" UserId="566242" />
