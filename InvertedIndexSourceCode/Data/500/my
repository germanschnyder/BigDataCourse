The problem is that the formatter of Visual Studio seems to ignore this in the case described and happily inserts line breaks where they are in fact significant. Therefore, if you follow the rule that you don't mix text and elements as content (that is, make all elements contain text only or elements with optional whitespace, but not both), the formatter will not break your documents. That's the reason why I wrote this simplification - it should help to avoid getting broken documents." CreationDate="2010-10-19T19:48:22.183" UserId="88558" />

If you really want linked-list semantics, then use `std::list`, though then you lose the indexability (no `operator[]`) so it's not really an array. `list` that has its own idiosyncracies such that `vector` is often a better choice. In Standard C++ containers, you are going to have to compromise one way or the other. Look at `deque`, that may offer better perf for you.

If you declare always ALL variables on the top of the functions, they will all always allocated whatever condition is. I think it has performance impact by the way, also if the allocation on stack in .NET is amazingly fast." CreationDate="2010-10-20T15:49:27.753" UserId="156695" />
