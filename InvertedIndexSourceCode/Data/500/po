Just use `-executeCommand:withArgs:` with the path to the command (@&quot;/bin/cp&quot; or @&quot;/bin/mv&quot;) to execute the move/copy operation. c) Yes, although `BLAuthentication` is *old*, it still compiles and runs perfectly fine, even under 10.6 (the security frameworks have barely changed over time)."

Currently I'm using the transpose and flip methods from OpenCV, it's the fastest out of all the image rotation methods I tried.

When you use `RAND` in a query, the database has to generate a random value for every row in the table, even if it only returns one row in the end. Worse, if you're going to `ORDER BY RAND`, it then has to sort the rows on an unindexed value, which is a relatively expensive operation. By adding the `WHERE RAND &gt; .9`, it's now generating 330k random numbers, but it only has to sort 30k unindexed values, since the 90% or records where the first `RAND` returns .9 or less get discarded before the `ORDER BY` is processed."

However, the problem is that in this case we still have *two* references to the position object, so we still need to do *two* updates atomically - thus locking can't be avoided :-(" CreationDate="2011-01-05T12:57:41.313" UserId="265143" />
