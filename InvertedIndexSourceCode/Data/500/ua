If it didn't, you could try using a loop to grab chunks of the varbinary data (say 8040 bytes) and create update statements to write those chunks to the target row.

Given that there isn't a 1:1 correspondence between managed threads and O/S threads, I think that Pinvoking ExitThread and GetExitCodeThread won't be a reliable solution.  I am considering deriving a new thread class from Thread that adds an exit code along with the appropriate methods to set it and retrieve it.  My concern is that since the retrieval of the exit code would happen after the thread has terminated, the GC may have disposed of the thread object before the exit code is retrieved.  Is there a way to guarantee that won't happen ?" CreationDate="2011-04-12T13:05:37.843" UserId="692286" />

So what i think happened was that at one point there was a physical log directory, and svn ignore was set on the *contents* of this dir, not the dir itself.  Then, later, the dir was replaced with a symlink to the shared folder, but nobody bothered tidying up svn.  So, i guess i need to move the symlink, make a new log dir, svn delete it, physically delete it, then put the symlink back and svn ignore that.  I'll do it later during a quiet usage time.  thx" CreationDate="2011-04-12T13:24:02.990" UserId="138557" />

You have a mutable value type in a read-only variable. The value type has two methods, DoNotMutate() and Mutate(). Describe how you would design an algorithm that decides when to give the warning based on a call to one of those methods. Do calls to both methods get the warning, even though one does not actually mutate the structure? That seems bad for users. Does only one method call get the warning? If so, how do you decide which one gets it and which one does not?" CreationDate="2011-04-12T14:08:47.667" UserId="88656" />

However when you write in 3. that what appears as superscript is just another text in another position I think it is not what I desire.

Considering example `A^v` there will be a lot of space between `A` and superscript `v`. In another case `E^b` there will be much less space then in previous case.
