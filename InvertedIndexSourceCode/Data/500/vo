When it tries to acquire the lock, it sees that the lock is already held, so it waits on the lock.

It's likely the ObjC runtime could now allow class variables, but there's no syntax for declaring them. And the C-level runtime reference states that &quot;Adding an instance variable to a metaclass is not supported&quot; via its relevant function, so although something the internals likely support, it isn't exposed. Class variables are a little alien to the ObjC mindset so that isn't surprising. I just meant it as a fun diversionary thought." CreationDate="2011-05-12T12:12:15.667" UserId="427332" />
