I think you need to greatly reduce the friction because the balls do not roll enough. This also seems to affect the torque as if I hit the ball on the edge it is hard to make it spin. From a gameplay aspect, it takes quite a while from when it appears that there is nothing happening (after a shot) before the balls sleep. Perhaps add a function to loop through and detect the current speed of the ball and if below a threshold make it sleep so I do not have to wait. Looks good otherwise."
