The reason for the &quot;may&quot; is because distinct hashCodes may map to the same value when you are using modulo arithmetic. For example. Hashcodes of 1 and 101 in a map with 100 buckets will map to the same bucket because 1 and 101 are congruent modulo 100. If however, your key space for hash values is the same as the number of buckets you have... then producing different values for different objects is in fact optimal."
