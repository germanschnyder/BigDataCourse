This plug-in looks like very nice, but in the real usage you will find a lot of restrictions. For example, If you define a telephone number mask as (999) 999-9999 and try to enter a short number like (999) 123-456 it will be not allowed (try in the demo). So some other Plug-Ins which look like not so nice but has more freedom in defining of rules for input can be more useful in the practice.

The original multi-threaded approach had something along the lines of a main thread running through the records, copying the data in DataTables and starting x new threads with given data-tables.&#xA;Then it waits until a thread has finished and starts it anew with a fresh DataTable. This worked decently too, yet it requires to actively keep checking for 'finished' threads which didn't feel optimal as said loop consumed quite a bit of CPU too, and adding Sleep(100) mitigated that but also slowed starting a new blocks down."
