If you don't include that, and someone puts a control on a form that your method doesn't know how to handle, it won't get disabled. -- IMO it would be better design to derive your own control classes (from the standard controls) that implement a common interface `IHaveReadOnlyProperty` (exposing a `ReadOnly` property). Your method then checks whether a control supports that interface; if so, it sets the exposed `ReadOnly` property to `false`; otherwise, it does the next-best thing, ie. it sets `Enabled` to `false`."

Instead, create a unique constraint over both VesselID and your M,P,S char field - what I called HullType in my answer. That way, you ensure a vessel has at most one hull of any given type. Now, weather a hull of a given type makes sense for a given vessel is another question, which you can resolve simply in code (possible in db model, but complex) You've got a complex domain model that you're mapping to the database - have you considered using a Object-Relational Mapping tool, e.g. NHibernate?"

That value was used as a fix. I'm trying to find the original link that explained how those settings were arrived at but I haven't been able to so far. Perhaps it is overkill though given that I only learned about the differences between browser cache and browser history after that research." CreationDate="2010-05-17T13:27:28.970" UserId="8753" />
