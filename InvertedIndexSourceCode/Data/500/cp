If they were all in the same group a runaway application could potentially use all the processing time for that group leaving nothing for the other applications.

An example of what I was saying about the optimizer: if the compiler was holding the current value of floatVal in a register, the optimizer would be entitled to assume that it didn't need to spill the current value to memory before executing this code, since those int pointers can't legally be accessing the float value.  So even if the undefined behavior didn't make your computer explode, you could easily be picking up random garbage rather than the latest value of floatVal with this code."
