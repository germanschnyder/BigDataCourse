I think that an abstract class in C++ that has only pure virtuals and no data members is what an interface is in Jave/C#. What I'm asking for is: _Is there any fundamental, underlying, core difference between &quot;implementing an interface&quot; and &quot;deriving from an abstract class&quot;?_ From what I know it seems Java's and C#'s interfaces are just restricted abstract base classes, and &quot;implementing an interface&quot; isn't any less complex as deriving from a base."
