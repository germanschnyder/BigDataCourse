This is done by passing a anonymous function (which the code in your example was returning), or by passing a variable reference to a function.

IMO it would be like a constant because you cant replace the value when invoking the closure. Parameters though can be passed on each invocation. The reason to not use parameters is because you *have* to pass them on each invocation. But what are use cases where you need the closure to recognize the reassignments to a variable *after* the closure has been defined? In your example this is used (only) for the counter variable i think. Is this behavior perhaps intended for *non-mutable* values (like int)?"
