Now, consider the worst case where `s` is not present, so each comparison has only 2 possible results. So with k operations, you can have only 2^k possible outputs, so you need 2^k≥n, i.e. k≥⌈log_2(n)⌉, which binary search achieves.

I answered *does switching to .Net require a complete re-design and re-write?* with **NO there are other options** and gave some references. Then at the end of my answer, if you reached it, I gave some of the links I consider most helpful for migration. That part would be useful for you I think.
