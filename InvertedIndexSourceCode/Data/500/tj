True, you could (or should?) simply use `\]` instead of a character class, but I wanted to mention that many regex implementations allow `[]]` to match a literal `]`. You don't even need to escape the `]`, since it is only a meta character inside a character class. Outside of it, only `[` needs to be escaped from the two square brackets (but escaping `]` doesn't hurt!)." CreationDate="2011-03-30T09:06:04.990" UserId="50476" />
