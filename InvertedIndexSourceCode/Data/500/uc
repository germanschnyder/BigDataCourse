Therefore if you had a more complex expression like (x + y) / z * 2, the compiler would have to do extra work to shrink the result of (x + y) to 16 bits, and to shrink the result of (x + y) / z to 16 bits again. The designers of C# may have felt that was wasteful (and probably not useful behavior to the programmer) so they chose to define all arithmetic results as 32 bits minimum."

The easiest way to make tests for automatch is to run two simulators (I think you'll need two macs), or one simulator and one device. For invitations, in my experience, they only way to make them work is on devices. I can get automatch to work both with two IPad simulators (4.3), one simulator (4.3) and one IPad (4.3.1), two IPads (both 4.3.1) or one IPad (4.3.1) and one IPhone (4.3). Hope it helps."
