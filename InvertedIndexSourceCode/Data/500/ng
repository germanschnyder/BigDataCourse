Then I need to override the Back button and refresh the previous page if it is pressed.  I think I may use your second suggestion - save off my state in onPause, and restore it in onResume.  In my case, &quot;state&quot; is simply a key value anyway, so that's super-easy.  So that way, the Back button still works without any extra work on my part, and I won't care if Android kills off any of my previous activities."
