Remember too that the program name is `argv[0]` and accounts for `argc` of `1`, hence the last argument is still only `argv[argc - 1]`.

The numpy arrays are actually stored in an hdf file (PyTables) and the variable class instance will know where they are stored and the class  override for __getattr__ can perform the &quot;lookup&quot; and return the numpy array. So, your suggestion would be to have a map to these object instances along with the __getattr__ override. It is a bit more verbose for the end user than what I had invisioned (tran.varMap[&quot;tempVar1&quot;] instead of tran.tempVar1 for example).
