The intriguing thing about TC is that it preemptively intercepts source control checkins, builds and verifies, and only commits the checkin to source control if the build and verification succeeds. Otherwise the offender is notified in a closed loop, and you don't run into the problem of bad code hitting any branch. I am not sure what kinds of deployment scenarios it supports, but deployment can be handled by the build script anyway. http://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/" CreationDate="2009-09-01T03:40:02.470" UserId="111554" />
