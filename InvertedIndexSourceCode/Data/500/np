So F prototype must be pointing to P's prototype. When we instantiate F, it contains you say a copy, but not a reference? apply() creates copies but object assignment creates references so when assigning prototype, isn't a refeence, not a copy, created from P to F? And if it's a reference, then that link from C to F to P should still exist. But obviously, it doesn't because your code works." CreationDate="2010-11-08T22:45:17.920" UserId="1392690" />

Doubles and Ints are very different and serve very different purposes.

We've got a lot of people here who know about Delphi and components, but it's a bit difficult to understand what you're looking for.  Would you mind editing your question so that there's a clear *question* in there somewhere?  Thanks." CreationDate="2010-11-09T17:44:56.153" UserId="32914" />

Your approach is something very unique, and not one I considered before as I am very new to iPhone programming and geolocation.  Is it possible for you to clarify further the theory about the scale factor?  I want my iPhone app to present to the user the closest specialty restaurants to where he/she is, and present them to the user in order of closest to furthest.  My SQLite table would contain the latitude/longitude coordinate pairs for each location.  If you could further clarify the concepts that you presented, I would really appreciate it. Thanks Again!"

The PostgreSQL JDBC driver, on the other hand, translates a given date to the default calendar time zone.  So you're correct that time zone translation is specific to the JDBC driver."
