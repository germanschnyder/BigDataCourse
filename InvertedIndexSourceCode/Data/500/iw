Also, you can re-write those ifs using the selector with commas, like this: `if ($(&quot;.whoweare:first, .squareleft3:first, .squareright:first&quot;).filter(&quot;:visible&quot;).length &gt; 0)`....much shorter :)  Do those things first, then your code will be very easy to parse."

And it's easiest for the factory to use `new` for allocating them, since they can then be passed back with an `auto_ptr&lt;&gt;` or `scoped_ptr&lt;&gt;`, which make cleanup automatic but have less overhead than `shared_ptr&lt;&gt;`."

It's important to remember that in Java, all objects are really references (in the Java sense, which is really somewhere between a C++ pointer and a C++ reference), and everything is virtual, so polymorphism always works. In C++, objects are value types, and so assigning two objects really does assign the value of the right side to the left, rather than making the left side be a reference to the same object as the right.

In fact, it'll probably be slower since its likely slower to preallocate a string in Perl than let perl do it.  You'll also waste a lot of memory since every string will be using the maximum memory.  Benchmarking bears this out.  If you really want this to be as fast as possible, write an XS wrapper around fgets().  Its fairly trivial (by XS standards)."
