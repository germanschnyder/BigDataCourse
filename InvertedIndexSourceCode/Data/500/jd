I guess you need to use a temp file, then, similarly to @DVK's answer, but just read in the temp file's contents from within perl after you get EOF from stdin. I thought about using a fifo instead, but that won't work because perl won't see EOF from stdin until the fifo's been read, and presumably wouldn't check the fifo until input was done, ie *deadlock*. Though I guess you could loop timed-out reads from stdin and the fifo until you consumed the fifo (and then got EOF from stdin). It's a bit complicated, and you'd still have to make the fifo anyway, but it's less messy than temp files." CreationDate="2010-06-09T15:10:54.227" UserId="192812" />
