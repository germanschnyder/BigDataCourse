Have you considered that the actual call might be, say, `memcpy(outp, inp, len)`? And that this could occur in code where `outp` and `inp` are dynamically allocated and are initially `0`? This works, e.g., with `p = realloc(p, len+n)` when `p` and `len` are `0`. I myself have used such a `memcpy` call -- while it is technically UB, I've never encountered an implementation where it isn't a no-op and don't ever expect to."

So repeating `A&lt;T&gt;::template` or `this-&gt;template` all over the code is not very appealing. The wrapper solution is more complex than `using` because a) it is much longer, but more important b) you have to repeat the signature of `f`, so whenever you change `f` in the base class you have to do changes accordingly in the inheriting class (or: in *all* 10 inheriting classes...).

The problem why I call reloadData is because I have a navigationcontroller, which has an &quot;Add&quot; button, it pushes the view to a new view where the user can input some details, and when he hits &quot;Save&quot; the navigationcontroller gets popped back and then it has to reload the data because the user just entered a new record... How can I accomplish that without reloadData?" CreationDate="2011-03-09T12:22:45.637" UserId="387556" />
