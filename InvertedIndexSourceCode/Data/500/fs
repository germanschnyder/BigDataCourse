With that in mind, you can put it there as a comment if you consider it only internal, or properly put it in the docstring if you consider it a contract with the user of the method.

I don't agree that it's byzantine, either - it seems perfectly natural to me. An integer really only has a &quot;first digit&quot; when you consider it in a formatted sense - so converting it to string and taking the first character is pretty obvious, isn't it?

One paragraph later in §6.6 is the sentence &quot;[n]ote that the existence of an implicit conversion from `E` to `D` does not guarantee that the compile-time application of the conversion will succeed without error&quot; basically admitting that the definition of &quot;implicit conversion&quot; from a method group to a delegate type can lead to ambiguity. I made the same mistake that you made and was hung up on the first sentence of §6.6. I wonder why the definition of implicit conversion will only consider parameter lists in cases such as this?"
