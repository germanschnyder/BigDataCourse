  <row Id="2316284" PostId="2333786" Score="2" Text="@sbi: No, I agree this answer is wrong, but for a different reason. The compiler indeed does `insert` with a `T()`, but inside insert is when it will use the allocator get memory for a new `T` then call `construct` on that memory with the parameter it was given, which is `T()`. So it is indeed possible to change the behavior of `operator[]` to have it return something else, but the allocator cannot differentiate why it's being called. So even if we made `construct` ignore it's parameter and use our special value, that would mean *every* constructed element had that value, which is bad."
