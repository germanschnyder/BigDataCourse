The problem with GetWindowTextW is that what you get back will depend on the window procedure of the window you're trying to get text from, in particular whether it's ANSI or Unicode.

Since one cannot inherit constructors, or define them in interfaces, there's no way around this, and no way to turn that construct into bytecode.

Based on all iOS-only games I've shipped to date, the fastest and easiest route would be to use OpenGL, Cocos or whatever for the substance of the gameplay, stick with UIKit for surrounding menus and screens. Almost all UIKit objects can accept custom graphics, so you still get to look how you want but the non-game things like buttons, scroll views, sliders, etc, all then act how the user expects (and with no real programming work on your part)."

On a machine with a 32 bit int, each of those pointers is expected to point to a 4 byte location meaning that scanning a value into `(int*)&amp;key[0]` will overwrite `key[0]`, `key[1]`, `key[2]` and `key[3]` with the actual Octal number in either key[0] or key[3] depending on if the architecture is little or big endian."

The MasterPage then Compresses and Combines the dependency references into a single script tag and a single link tag.  Clearly, I can't know what dependencies will be required until after I know which partial views are being rendered, because different partial views have different dependencies.  Do you understand?"
