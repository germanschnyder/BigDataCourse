Unix timestamps are the number of seconds from January 1, 1970, and exist independent of timezone.

Also, instead of trying to use the `&lt;%= Element.ClientID %&gt;`, even though it would work, use the `id$=` as you don't need to know the ClientID for that. It will search for an element that &quot;ends with&quot; whatever you put after that.  So in our case, it would be whatever you named the elements, e.g. `txtGiftCardNumber` and `txtGiftCardPin`.  Much easier.  Also, right above the triggered `click()` event, you could do an `alert(&quot;triggering click&quot;);` just to verify it's working."
