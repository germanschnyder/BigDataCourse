It might be easier to use pointers or smart pointers to manage your `Camera` instances than to make them copy-safe. You should declare a copy constructor and a copy-assignment operator for `Camera` and make them private for safety. If you have access to boost or tr1 you could use a `std::vector&lt; tr1::shared_ptr&lt;Camera&gt; &gt;` .  If you use raw pointers you probably need to make your `CameraManager` non-copyable and add a simple loop deleting the dynamically allocated cameras in the desctructor.

There are plenty of times where signed works just fine, and you're better able to find bugs since you'll end up with negative numbers instead of really small or really big positive ones when wrapping around due to an error.
