Im still a little confused on how to use the setSelected: method? Will the tableCell automatically adjust it height after calling expandCell/contractCell and more importantly would it appear as if the selected cell is expanding and not simply being reloaded which is the initial problem i ran into? I called reoloadRowsAtIndex in didSelectRowAtIndex and while that worked you could visually see the cell being reloaded, either from the top/bottom/etc. depending on the animation style chosen."

The flow seems to be (1) Java gets correct filename from OS (2) Java writes filename to stdout, where it gets mangled (3) you take the mangled filename and pass it back in to a different tool (4) Java hands the mangled filename to the OS, which can't find the file.

Secondly, null as a &quot;placeholder&quot; for a value that isn't present is a redundant feature - if a value is not present then the same information can more accurately be represented by a tuple without that attribute."

Humans (and wasps for that matter) depend on unique features of a landscape to navigate successfully. If my guess is correct, changes in elevation won't do much to break isotropy. However a stand of trees or a distinctively shaped mountain or lake will break perceived isotropy over the whole range they are visible, but being in an array of mountains, lakes or endless forest won't. Creators of large MMOGs are keenly aware of this and go to much non-random, human, effort to break isotropy." CreationDate="2010-06-20T21:45:22.083" UserId="282912" />
