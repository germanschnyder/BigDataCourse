If you have enough money and can dedicate a million computers to cracking one hash, you can probably do it, but it's not worth it.  When you give someone server access you are often decreasing the effort side of the equation orders of magnitude.  It's a risk every company must take.  That said, there is a place for proper security so it does take 100 years to crack something. :)" CreationDate="2010-09-17T19:57:16.613" UserId="177333" />

Our backup/recovery strategy based on reloading files has worked extremely well for a number of years and we really want to keep it.   But I was under the impression from the BCU 2.1 overview document that we could now perform tablespace backups without a full database backup to base it upon.   This is the scenario that I'd prefer, since it won't require new storage hardware, and the newly added transactional tablespace in question is less than 0.1% of the size of the rest of the database.  I'll keep ACS in mind though - I am looking at a hardware refresh for 2011." CreationDate="2010-09-18T19:00:14.470" UserId="217403" />
