When you declare [private class ListLoc&lt;E&gt;] you are telling the jvm that this class can replace the element (E) with another Object derivative (say Integer or String). When you actually declare an instance of ListLoc, you need to specify what Object type you plan to use for the element. So when the object is created, it will know to check for the specified object type. If anything is unclear please ask add comments" CreationDate="2010-10-21T21:06:42.973" UserId="55913" />
