In general, for other kinds of exceptions you need to fake whatever throws the exception. This is *much* easier if you can design the code under test to use dependency injection in the first place, but for example if you need to fake a network interface and can't change the code under test, you might still be able to mess about with header files and/or libraries linked against, to slide in a wrapper layer."
