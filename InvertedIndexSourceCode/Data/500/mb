You can't have a &quot;project&quot; to create code without testing. Testing is a first-class part of coding.  If you're trying to describe a &quot;project&quot; that produces &quot;untested&quot; code, you're not really talking about software development, or costs or schedules or anything related to that.  You're talking about randomly creating code.  Any veneer of project management -- with no testing -- is some kind of elaborate lie." CreationDate="2010-09-21T17:57:45.467" UserId="10661" />
