A simple test on Windows 7 shows that if you try to use directly `CreateEvent` or `CreateMutex` instead of probing with `OpenEvent` or `OpenMutex` you receive no time `ERROR_ALREADY_EXISTS` error. Instead of that you **open** the existing event/mutex with respect of `CreateEvent` or `CreateMutex` exactly like with `OpenEvent` or `OpenMutex`.

All the time I'm thinking about the use of `IEqualityComparer` in terms of using it in hash table like collection(for example that Dictionary). In that case GetHashCode is always called on each object that is added to the collection. However equality of objects is tested only sometimes. So creating hash code is more performance critical then equality testing. That's why I wrote that you might want to skip some properties from hash code generation when it would take long time to generate their hash code but you always want to add them in equality testing."

If you encrypt a message, an attacker can always know the size of the message (or at least that it's smaller than some number, in case you pad it). The problem is two-fold. He's reusing the key if the length(message) &gt; length(key) and he's using a addition instead of a char. Since he's using an addition, the distribution of values for an encrypted character &quot;a&quot; will be biased towards smaller values than a character &quot;z&quot;.

E.g. `parseNumber :: String -&gt; Int` is a bad choice since it doesn't cover the possibility that parsing fails. `parseNumber :: String -&gt; Maybe Int` states this clearly without the danger of ending up with undefined values."

You probably wouldn't do that intentionally, but if you use public inheritance, the compiler allows implicit conversion from the derived to the base class -- which makes an accident pretty easy. It's undefined because with it non-virtual, the compiler does like usual, and invokes the dtor based on the type of the pointer instead of the type of the object it points at.

You could then check to see that X form being looked at by `eval` is a macro (look in your env map, see that it's a macro somehow), and then treat it accordingly (e.g. let `env` do the re-writing before executing). So you'd essentially be expanding your `eval` function to handle one more case, but you wouldn't need another primitive necessarily. Just some sort of way for `eval` to recognize that it has encountered a macro." CreationDate="2010-08-23T19:25:25.170" UserId="142240" />

Indeed this project references some files from another project, but there's no loop. Both project build correctly from build.xml and run fine when started manually."

I believe that they don't really care what you're doing as long as you're not causing a lot of trouble, but at the end of the day most of their customers are doing webhosting so aren't doing too much.  I do know that they try to work with people that are causing problems, and not just say &quot;Sorry, go away&quot;.  The other limitation are servers and persistent processes, but I've had (low cpu using) processes running for a while, I think they have a kill set up for processes after a week."
