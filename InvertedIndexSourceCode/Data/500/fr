The clue is that `data()` and `c_str()` don't invalidate iterators or references, so the implementation cannot &quot;throw away&quot; any previous non-contiguous storage it was using. It's undefined behaviour to modify the array you get back from `c_str()` or `data()`, whereas with vector you can modify the array you get from `&amp;v[0]` and it modifies the vector. This is a load of old rubbish, and nobody implements string non-contiguously, which is why C++0x is changing it ;-)" CreationDate="2010-01-10T14:37:56.073" UserId="13005" />

One solution to the problem of keeping changes in memory is to keep a changelog  (or changelogs) on disk which is append-only.
