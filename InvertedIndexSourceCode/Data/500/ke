The thing is, your assignment operator would have to just do nothing, which is about as far from &quot;assigning&quot; as it gets. While there are certainly ways to hack around the problem, the more correct solution would be to recognize the design consequences. That is, if a class has a const member, it doesn't make conceptual sense to copy or assign it; that's why I recommend disabling those operations entirely. However, another way to go is to get rid of the const part, allowing real assignments to occur. (Obviously this choice depends on your big picture, which I don't know.)"

Yes, they're both in the same hierarchy (subclasses of `NSObject` vs. species in *Chordata*) but they're very different things. --- If instead you mean *comparing* two objects of different types (as in your updated question), you can instead cast both to `id`, which they both are (so it's a safe comparison.) e.g. `(id)someValue == (id)[NSNull null]` would be valid. Better still would be to store the dictionary in an `id` to begin with, and only do the cast to `NSString` *after* you check the type." CreationDate="2010-07-18T03:13:03.807" UserId="265530" />

  <row Id="3388257" PostId="3274479" Score="0" Text="@zvrba, I think what Joel's getting at is that there is no requirement for a void * to be a 32-bit int. I can easily envisage an architect where the pointers are (for example) 24 bits and integers are 128 bits. It's even possible for a weird but conforming implementation that forces alignment to 16 bytes, to only allow 28 bits for pointers and automatically multiply them by 16 to get the real address. Bottom line, you cant store a type wider than a pointer, in the pointer itself." CreationDate="2010-07-18T08:29:51.130" UserId="14860" />
