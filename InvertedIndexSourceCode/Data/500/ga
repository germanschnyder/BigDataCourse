Every 1 in the original matrix is turned off and 3 other cells are toggled to keep the row/column sums constant. Those 3 fixes are as random as they can be, subject to the constraints of the problem. If there is a non-random aspect, it comes from the fact that the 1's in the original matrix have a higher-than-random chance of being 0's in the new matrix. One way to correct for that bias might be to skip some proportion of 1's in the original matrix -- in other words, leave them as is. What proportion? Perhaps use the density."
