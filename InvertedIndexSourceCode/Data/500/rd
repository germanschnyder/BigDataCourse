By sorting the array alphabetically we simplify the titleForHeaderInSection: code to just one line, the section index now correlates directly with the index in our sorted array so we just retrieve the section.  The same method works for the cellForRowAtIndexPath: method too.  Ensure you have the arrays running the table correctly sorted and you will simplify a lot of code.  If data is added/deleted/changed/reordered simply resort the array, for that reason put the code into its own function." CreationDate="2011-02-11T11:46:42.840" UserId="386679" />

The only way I know of to tackle that is to use .NET Reflector, choose the property setter you're interested in, right click and choose Analyze, and then clicked &quot;Used By&quot;, just to see where the values *might* be coming from. Reflector Pro also has an option to debug decompiled code, so you could use that to put a breakpoint in a setter in code you don't own.
