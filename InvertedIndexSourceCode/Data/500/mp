When you do foo.Method, the compiler looks up Method on the static type of foo, and its ancestors, until it finds a definition. At runtime, it calls it; if it's virtual, it will end up calling the most derived definition (override) of that method. Hiding the base method (a) prevents ancestors from overriding the method, and (b) stops them from being the most derived definition (override) of that method. This is because it's hidden.

This is no way useful as it requires user attention and response. I think its case with all androids and generally happens when device sleeps a long time. So will holding a partial wake lock solve it completely ? But then this is useless for keeping device always on. So also is the case for accelerometer, which switches off in some androids like HTC Tattoo when it sleeps, even CPU wake lock won't work, you need to hold partial or full wake lock.
