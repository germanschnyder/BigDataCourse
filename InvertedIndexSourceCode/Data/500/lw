Probably you're doing something like: `var myContainer:Sprite = myButtonsPanel.section2.redArea;` and then `myContainer.myButton`. `Sprite` is &quot;sealed&quot;.

This compiles if you type `myContainer` as a `MovieClip`, since a `MovieClip` is `dynamic. So, properties could be added to it at runtime.

GetTheObjectSet though is a smart method - it understands that DerivedType is inherited from BaseType and returns ObjectSet&lt;BaseType&gt;, which cannot be cast to ObjectSet&lt;DerivedType&gt; (again - line 3). This WILL throw InvalidCast at runtime. Not for the T = BaseType, but for T = DerivedType. Yet your note on ObjectSet : ObjectQuery gave me the solution. Thx!"
