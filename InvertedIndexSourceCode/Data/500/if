I can't agree that if test is not failing it gives you no information. Every test incorporates a piece of knowledge about the system, invariant if you wish. Invariant shouldn't change and if after refactoring test passes that means that functionality you had before you still have now. If `test_multiplyBy2` is not failing even when you are using square then the test is bad. I'm looking for a way to write a good test." CreationDate="2010-04-30T14:39:05.450" UserId="1423922" />

The hiding in question compiles quietly and results in an invisibly hidden member - and likely a runtime bug. Why not at least warn to that level for this kind of hiding (and allow the new keyword to work the same)? I'm sure this kind of hiding is harder for the compiler to find, since it's not just signature matching, but also parameter base type discovery; however, hiding in this way on purpose seems a bit too clever to be good design, and I think hiding in this way is more likely to be by mistake than by design."

It's not a Von Neumann machine; it says C was not designed for Hardvard Architecture, so any implementation of C language on that machine will surely be very non-standard, check the footnote. In essence, you cannot make C program that can run on all machine architectures.  In Von Neumann architecture, memory can contain both instruction and data, thus have only one address space, hence same pointer size, the runtime can do sort of things like patching its own code during runtime and running runtime-generated instructions" CreationDate="2010-05-01T00:48:28.353" UserId="11432" />
