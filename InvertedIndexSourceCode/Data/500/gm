I would guess (with no proof) that in IE all inputs handle internally the same set of properties and attributes (including `width` since it exists in image inputs; I'd expect similar behaviour from, say, `src` or `checked` or `maxlength`) and in some way disable attributes that are not appropriate to the input's type while leaving unrecognised attributes untouched. In short, for custom attributes, you'd be best off using attribute names that are not used by any type of input." CreationDate="2010-02-15T14:32:38.200" UserId="96100" />
