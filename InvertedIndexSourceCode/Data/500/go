So some components in your code play the role of node, some of edge. For example, a parse tree can be seen as a directed acyclic graph: the nodes are the operators and constants, and the edges represent association. For example, parsing 1+2*3 would give you a tree with + as root, 1 as leftmost child, * as rightmost child, and * would have 2 as leftmost child, and 3 as rightmost child" CreationDate="2010-02-17T19:37:30.617" UserId="235058" />

If I had just a single pair of matrices (actually these are matrix rows as I am doing a QR decomposition using givens rotations) then there would be no or few conflicts.  The problem is I think that subsequent pairs of matrices will now be disaligned to the shared memory banks.

So as long as the struct stays the same, you can just memcpy() the raw data.  You'd have a few bogus bytes of padding, and any multi-byte fields would be in target-endian form, but it would work in the sense that data you &quot;encoded&quot; into a byte stream could then be &quot;decoded&quot; into the same struct.  This is dumbed-down, for sure, but I wasn't sure what you were going for.  If this seems obvious and trivial, just ignore me.  :)" CreationDate="2010-02-18T14:44:26.797" UserId="7046" />
