If you then do `$b[] = &quot;new item&quot;` only then does PHP copy the entire array and make the change. You can test this by checking memory usage of a large array if you like. memory usage is only bumped up after *changing* the second array, not during assignment. Try it."

You could always just have the mex file call system(&quot;mpirun..&quot;), if that's allowed, or even have it call a bash script which calls mpirun... I can see where you want to avoid these multiple layers.  Another thing I just tried which seems to work with OpenMPI -- but is so horrible that I'm ashamed to have my name associated with it on SO -- is the following:  `int fakeargc = 6; char **fakeargv = {&quot;mpirun&quot;, &quot;--hostfile&quot;,&quot;mpihosts.txt&quot;,&quot;-np&quot;,&quot;1&quot;,&quot;./parentjob&quot;}; MPI_Init(&amp;fakeargc, &amp;fakeargv);`.  I can't imagine that's recommended, or would even work reliably with other MPIs." CreationDate="2010-11-24T03:54:24.027" UserId="463827" />
