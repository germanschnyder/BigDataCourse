This repeater is within a WARP panel (AJAX panel), and the grids within the repeater contain buttons in their cells that make changes to the grid.  For instance, there's an &quot;Edit&quot; button, that when clicked, changes the contents of a grid cell to a textbox instead of a label.  When I turn off the ViewState, clicking that add button makes all the content of the repeater vanish (because it's not being retained in the ViewState to be rebuilt I assume).  With the temporary controls, I store them in session and re-add.  So those might not be using VS." CreationDate="2009-11-16T17:09:55.103" UserId="146" />

For number fields, the formatter prints at least the number of digits (0 prefixed) corresponding to the number of pattern characters. When parsing, the number of pattern characters is irrelevant, except for the year field, for which the number of characters has a specific meaning. The patterns &quot;yyy-M-d H:m:s.S&quot; and &quot;yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSSSSS&quot; are hence identical for the parser." CreationDate="2009-11-17T18:23:35.583" UserId="180659" />
