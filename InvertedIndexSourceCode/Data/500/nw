Taking a pointer to an automatic variable and storing it in an instance variable is undefined behavior — it's a bug or a crash waiting to happen. Questions to ask yourself to find the right solution: *Why* is that instance variable a pointer? If there's a reason it needs to be, what is that reason? You need to design your code properly around that constraint. Otherwise, don't make it a pointer." CreationDate="2010-11-16T17:58:19.753" UserId="50742" />

Also, if you are called from C#, you pay a context-switch penalty every time you cross the managed/unmanaged boundary -- so API's with a heavy C backend cannot be granular.
