The method is clever, and I used it to produce complex XML files, but Access has a bug: when you export a report as text, sometimes lines are swapped ! They look good in preview, but in the final text file, the last line of a page &quot;goes up&quot; 2 or 4 lines. And your xml (in your case html) does not validate anymore. I ended up rewriting everything in VBA, going back to the good ol' days of loops and breaks." CreationDate="2011-01-24T20:38:51.240" UserId="78522" />

I know that template code is usually inlined by the compiler since it is generated in the same translation unit than that of the code that instantiates the template.

(ie: to prevent the generation of a stand-alone definition of the function) Also, why does the STL implementation of GCC use this keyword all over the place?
