When you see that element 0 has value 1 you swap the value with element 1 so now element 1 has value 5 and element 1 has value 1. You then loop the loop and say &quot;Hurrah - element 1 has value 1 - it must be the duplicate!&quot;. Wrong. And moreover you now never get to check the value 5 in element 0. If element 2 contains 0, then you merely swap the 0 and the 5 AFTER you check the 2 and then move on, still never checking the 5." CreationDate="2010-12-23T11:54:31.403" UserId="526477" />

The main reason why Scala distinguishes between the collection type and the representation type is so that types which aren't part of Scala's collection framework, such as `String`, can still inherit all the collection methods. For proper collections, the representation type is usually the same as the type of the collection itself. `CanBuildFrom[Repr, B, That]` is a builder factory which will produce a builder that can create a `That` collection with element type `B` from a collection with repr. type `Repr`."
