To say that design patterns are &quot;just tricks&quot; and that the GoF is only useful because &quot;they became famous&quot; is completely ignoring the fact that a good design requires planning and an understanding of how to build that design with an understanding of WHY you are using a design.  Sure, I can accidentally stumble onto a good design, just as a architect can stumble upon a good structure for a building.  Doesn't mean the software or the building is designed well.

An exit function-call is a much nicer idiom in many cases - especially to allow the code to be shared by other functions (e.g. &quot;file parsing failed&quot; error in a parser made up of 20 different functions that all operate on the same file). The advantages of using goto in this situation are that the cleanup code is embedded within the same function, and that it is executed by default, so it's harder to forget to call it."
