If you're not getting line returns while with the `pre` tags, there must be something odd, I would guess. At least there is no need for `echo` with ` print_r`. You could also have a look at the [PHP manual for ` print_r`](http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.print-r.php) where many [user contributed comments](http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.print-r.php#87418) also feature `pre` tags.
