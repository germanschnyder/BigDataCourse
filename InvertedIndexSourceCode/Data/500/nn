In a length extension attack the attacker generates the internal hash algorithm state from the hash value and then feeds more data into the hash algorithm and generates a new hash.  This can allow an attacker to add data to a message in certain circumstances or do other nasty things.  I'm not expecting the new hash to be more collision resistant.  In fact, I'm a little worried it would be less.  But it definitely is much more resistant to length extension." CreationDate="2010-11-06T21:21:19.040" UserId="167958" />
