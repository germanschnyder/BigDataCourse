The reason for this is that the gem adds an after_save method which calls :upload_to_scribd, and it is this in particular which I want to delay. Could I simply explicitly set after_save :upload in conjunction with the method from your answer? Would this override the default after_save from ScribdFu? If not, how can I override this? If it was not overridden, upload_to_scribd would be called twice - once by the gem and once via the explicit upload method." CreationDate="2011-02-27T10:32:38.040" UserId="534583" />

In terms of why it matters what the lorem ipsum text says - my take on article vs section is that if you have a single coherent unit of content, that's an article. If you have a bag of related units that's a section. In the case of &quot;Our Products&quot; that's plural, so maybe you have a bag of descriptions of each of your products - a section - or maybe you have a description of how great your products are in general.

I haven't done enough testing to be able to say for sure, but I'd imagine that Microsoft has done something similar there as well. The point is that they want their exception-handler dialog to show up without the developer having to do anything. You want to override that, so you have to work harder."

For large collections this may have a drastic impact on performance. [Write Performance] On the contrary, lists can grow indefinitely without having to move data.
