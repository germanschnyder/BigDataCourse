It's idiomatic Cocoa that initializers, which include the `-init` methods and generally the class convenience initializers like `+string` return type `id`.

That said, it's not required and probably doesn't make much difference. Someone with deeper Cocoa history could weigh in on this." CreationDate="2010-06-26T19:15:54.327" UserId="73297" />
