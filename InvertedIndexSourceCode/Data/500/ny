I just need to understand (quickly) how to talk to it securely :-(" CreationDate="2010-11-18T14:24:45.790" UserId="2671514" />

The second db is only ever updated once a statement is inserted. This way the interface is simpler and applications don't have to query the log to get the last available check (in case a check failed to be written to the log). Does that make sense?
