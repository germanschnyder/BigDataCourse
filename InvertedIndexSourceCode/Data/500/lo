I have one operator()(T) using enable_if and it does what I want, i.e., type-safety and a simple solution. One problem however, is that the code won't compile (with VS10) if I initialise the variant as- sql_field charField(CharStruct()). I get an error 'lhs of .apply_visitor must be class/struct/union.' It compiles ok if instead I initialise variant using sql_field charField = CharStruct(). I guess this could be the problem of delegating the constructor to the base class?
