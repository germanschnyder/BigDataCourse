Also I would expect little performance impact from using `long` (current CPUs operate on 64bit numeric values as they do on 32bit), unless cache size becomes a factor. However doing a two stage sort (`Sign(x)` then `Abs(x)` and therefore not needing a type conversion also has overheads: I would expect the difference would only show up in very large datasets (1MB cache can hold &gt;130k long values...)."

While normally you just throw inside a constructor when it fails in some way, it is perfectly possible to try/catch inside a constructor to handle other failures and avoid failure of said constructor in the first place (or, rethrow). Depending on the situation, this may be preferrable. For example, if you construct two objects in your constructor, and the second one throws bad_alloc, what do you do?

It seems that the magic in the machine has less to do with the computation model and more to do with the bounds on the data and whether you can compare arbitrary length data in `O(1)` time. If comparison is `O(1)`, then we have `Ω(n log n)`. If not, then we have `Ω(n log^2 n)`, the extra log coming from the comparison at each node. On the other hand, if we limit data size, then both logs drop out and we have `Θ(n)`. All of this assumes `Θ(1)` access to memory.
