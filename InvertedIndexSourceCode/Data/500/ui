The problem is that that list in `x[1]` doesn't have names so `x[1][[ &quot;a&quot; ]]` returns NULL but we're trying to assign a length 1 vector to a `length(0)` index. It works if you do `x[1][[ 1 ]]`, but as you say, much better if the OP works directly with a list not an array." CreationDate="2011-04-18T17:12:47.657" UserId="429846" />
