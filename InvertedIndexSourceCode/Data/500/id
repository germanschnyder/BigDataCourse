I am more interested in finding an upper bound for when the game does branch out beyond a small number of moves, and it can branch out really fast. Yes, there are 20 ways the first move can be played, but 69352859712417 ways the 10th move can be played. But you're right, when you have 20/400/8902 possible moves for the first three plies respectively, then probability of hitting one from the database is quite high, but reduces exponentially with each move."

Among other things, one of the most useful is to be able to commit your current code, make some changes to test something out, and then revert back to your last commit if your changes didn't work out. This is a lot simpler than saving a copy, reverting files manually, or whatever you do currently when you're not sure if a change will stick. You also don't have to know in advance that you might want to revert something (a big plus). You can also look into branching and merging when things get more complex."
