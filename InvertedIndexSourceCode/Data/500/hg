So I can write `let get_A x = x#A()`, where x is a generic type `'a` that exposes a property `val A : unit -&gt; 'b`.

Languages with auto-(un)boxing are not free of problems — in fact, many of them are hard to spot and can cause strange issues. For example, Effective Java and Java Puzzlers devote quite a few pages to clearing up confusion about how numbers act unexpectedly in various situations. It would be quite convenient to have auto-boxing, but adding it to the language itself (as you point out) would be non-trivial, and likely fraught with hidden perils."
