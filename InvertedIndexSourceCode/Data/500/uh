I don't know how you're arriving at O(1) runtime. Your comment &quot;as long as the maximum number of digits is constant&quot; implies that some inputs won't be valid for having a fluctuating maximum length. That's simply incorrect. You don't even need to make a pass through the input to determine the maximum number of digits. You simply look at the first one, then the second, then the third, etc... If you reach the fourth digit of a 2 length string, you pretend you found the lowest possible value." CreationDate="2011-04-17T04:00:11.040" UserId="330057" />

Simple loop where you find row by rowid is too slow. Moreover would recommend you to use local data paging. 1500 rows can not be displayed at once.
