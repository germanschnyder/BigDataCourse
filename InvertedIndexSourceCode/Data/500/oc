And it is a better practice to do complex processing in a stored proc that the dba can performance tune than to put things like this on the application. Further almost all cursors that are run from the application can easily be replaced with set-based logic. Cursors are rarely needed except for some dba-oriented administrative tasks. If you are inserting, updating or deleting from one or more tables, you can do that in a set-based way pretty close to 100% of the time." CreationDate="2010-11-22T23:20:17.443" UserId="9034" />

The problem there is that reinterpreting an unsigned char as a char can result in a different value from converting it to char, and you'd have to check the specific functions to know which one is appropriate. If char is unsigned, or if it's 2's complement (and the implementation uses the obvious conversion), then there's no difference." CreationDate="2010-11-23T13:05:44.927" UserId="13005" />
