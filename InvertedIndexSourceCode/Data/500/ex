The filter functions are a messy bag of unrelated string-formatting functions, some of which are useful for validation but some of which are quite unsuitable for an input stage. I agree that it's a bit rough. Although INPUT_REQUEST wouldn't be needed much if you can use INPUT_POST|INPUT_GET|INPUT_COOKIE (who wants to lump cookies into form pars anyway?), it would seem trivial enough to implement. There doesn't seem to have been much development since filter moved from PECL to builtin." CreationDate="2009-12-01T19:08:11.620" UserId="18936" />
