If it's (2), then something like [`delay &gt;&gt;&gt; 0`](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3081987/) happens, so the delay passed is zero.

This new data won't have originated from a PHP foreach loop and therefore I won't be able to insert the data into the database because PHP doesn't know it exists. Is there a way around this?"
