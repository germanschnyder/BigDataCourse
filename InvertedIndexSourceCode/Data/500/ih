Just by looking at the assembly code generated by modern compiler one can see that, for example, on x86 platform integer multiplication by a constant is usually translated into a `lea` operation, not into shifts. Like, multiplying something by `3` would turn into `lea eax, [eax * 2 + eax]` and so on. Multiplication by `4` simply turns into a `lea eax, [eax * 4]` since it is more efficient than a shift."
