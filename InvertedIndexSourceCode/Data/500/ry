Also consider that if you add a static Values property to SomeEnum that simply passes through to AbstractEnum&lt;SomeEnum&gt;.Values, that also works, but the goal was to avoid having to write more code in the &quot;enum&quot; classes."

As said, with Spring TestContext you can initialize your application, run a single test, do changes without need to redeploy (although you would probably need to re-start the TestContext). Also, I don't know what sorts of tests you are planning to run on Struts, but you can conveniently run Selenium tests against any web framework if functional tests are what you're after. You could also run Selenium through Spring TestContext to access the same DB :)" CreationDate="2011-03-01T14:32:24.403" UserId="165629" />
