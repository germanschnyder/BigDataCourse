Just needed to explore the avenue - I am returning to the shell script path as it seems to be a lot more reliable and consistent." CreationDate="2011-01-12T01:45:38.847" UserId="568589" />

So the way jQuery's `.delegate()` method works specifically, is that the first argument you pass is the *selector* that will be used to test the element *inside* the container that was clicked. In your case, you're passing `.active .button`. So any element inside the container that when clicked matches that selector, jQuery will fire the handler. That's why clicking a `.button` that descends from `.active` will invoke the handler, but when you remove the `active` class, that same button will no longer do so because it no longer matches the selector.

Maybe you could make a new question describing the problem in more detail and reduce this one to its original form, so the new problem gets some attention. I would probably start with checking what the database actually stores (select character codes of single characters) and if that's proper UTF-8. Then check what PHP receives (char codes again). Then check if that's consistent with the Content-Type header. Then what the browser receives (via FireBug or WireShark)." CreationDate="2011-01-12T16:54:13.970" UserId="18771" />
