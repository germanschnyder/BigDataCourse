If you click it then it can correct the problem for you by adding the framework for the method you are trying to override; also if you are using Extends instead of Implements, be sure to use @override in front of your method.  @override will warn you if the method signature is incorrect (this is not really necessary with implements since you will already get the error that you got, but with extends you wouldn't have gotten any errors, your listener would simply never fire)" CreationDate="2010-06-29T18:30:49.237" UserId="12943" />
