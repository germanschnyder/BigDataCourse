Since the constant `11644473600` does not have a suffix, the compiler interprets it as a long int and throws a warning because the number overflows the long int.  The cast isn't the problem; as written in the sample, the code is casting a 32-bit number into a 64-bit number.  The compiler's interpretation of the number as a 32-bit value is the problem, and explicitly marking the number as &quot;long long&quot; forces the compiler to treat it as a 64-bit number."

The &quot;mykey.pem&quot; in the question is, of course, a PEM key.  &quot;DER&quot; is used to indicate the binary form. But even when you distinguish binary from base-64, you still need to know the expected structure of the key: PKCS #8, or native OpenSSL. The DER or PEM is just a final layer of encoding. &quot;base64-encoded DER&quot; really doesn't make any sense. How would that be different from PEM? Did you try my code?"
