What code review workflow should we use, what review software, what testing framework (and depending, what separate coverage measurement tool), how to integrate each of those with your SCM, and maybe even whether you should switch to Git. (Unless that tag is a red herring.) I can tell you that if you use Git you can use a hook to reject publishing of commits which don't meet your standards, but that's the easy part - being able to determine that the code meets the standards is hard, and depends on all your tools."
