I'm almost certain the answer is &quot;No - it could not be done&quot;, but I'm not quite sufficiently sure of what you're proposing.

A good cryptographic hash (even MD5, which is not the worlds strongest by a large margin) will not allow you to deduce anything meaningful using a mechanism such as the one I think you are describing."
