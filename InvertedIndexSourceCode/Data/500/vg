Unfortunately I don't think this would generalize to arbitrary expressions. For example, I don't think one can write a regular expression of the form &quot;`PATTERN without SUBPATTERN within`&quot; (what I think entonio was trying to say). This works, as you've demonstrated, if PATTERN is of the form `[charset]*`, but if for example one had a sufficiently complicated PATTERN, I don't think this could be done naturally?
