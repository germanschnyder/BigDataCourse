Can you do something drastic like switching to [SQLite3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQLite) for all your data storage? You could read in the input file into an SQLite database, do your work, and then write the output file in your own format again. (If it must interop.) Let someone else handle high-speed access. :) (Or: write your own _binary_ format with fixed-length records for everything. See `fread(3)`. Poor corruption handling, but excellent random access.)"
