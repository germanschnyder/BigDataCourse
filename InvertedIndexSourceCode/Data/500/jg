The reason is that, unlike `std::list`, `std::vector` (a dynamic array) stores its data contiguously, which usually makes for less cache misses.

This isn't the only use of pointers!  You can also pass in pointers to objects if you want to modify them; for instance, many methods take an  `error:(NSDictionary**)err`.  You can't modify passed-in arguments, as they're copied, but since you can dereference a pointers, they can do something like `*err = myErrInfo` so that the caller can see it.  There are other references which explain pointers (and probably StackOverflow questions); check them out!" CreationDate="2010-06-13T10:16:59.543" UserId="237428" />

In case of saving URLs to return the visitor to, you should be fine with just saving them as strings. I think saving that URL, but then changing parts of it is a rather contrived example. In that case you'd rather just save the part you're interested in, like `$this-&gt;params['action']`, and then cobble together a new URL in the standard array format. I think if there was a real need to convert the formats back and forth, somebody would have added that functionality by now. :)" CreationDate="2010-06-14T01:10:02.900" UserId="476" />
