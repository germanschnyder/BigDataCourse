In your example the first if statement has nothing to do with the second if/else statement, they are completely separate, hence why the else in the second statement will run if the first is true and the second is false, because the first statement has absolutely no bearing on it.  It's a completely separate and self contained logic process and can have it's own elseifs and else.  Any time you use `if(something)` it's a totally new block of logic which can be extended by elseifs and an else.  Of course, they can be contained within other blocks of logic."

Now if I select India(3) the selected option would populate the text field with India(3). What is desired is that only India should be populated in the text field as the search button would query for only India alone and it would also look very odd if (3) is also present beside India.
