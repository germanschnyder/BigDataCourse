Most obvious downside is that it doubles the number of classes required. Also if FooImpl wasn't opaque, it might tempt people to use it directly and skip Foo. However, it's unlikely that it would be opaque since the point of NVIs are to allow people to override the virtual implementations, so FooImpl would have to be publicly accessible. Even though it has its own downsides, I think implementing NVI in one class and avoiding public virtual functions all together is a better approach."
