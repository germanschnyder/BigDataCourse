Looking at the `&lt;itemTemplate&gt;` I see your `list&lt;TestProgram&gt;` program, and it is a datasource, but I don't see a data repeater or other data control that is being bound. (where are the view_program or edit_program controls that should support `&lt;itemTemplate&gt;`?). If they are outside the scope of what you have shown, by putting the multview inside the repeater but outside the item template could be disrupting the order of operations on your page.  Step back from the page you have and start by building a page with multiview, some buttons and a drop down, etc." CreationDate="2011-04-29T12:40:41.413" UserId="681009" />
