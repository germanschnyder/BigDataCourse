Then you just cast the TList &quot;array&quot; to your descendant object type to get at the dynarray. Have looked at the new Starter version of Delphi XE? only $149."

For example, you should only add an association between two models when your code requires it. When your app attempts to use that association because of a test then it will fail. Then you add the association to satisfy the test. This way you have a much more flexible test framework. If you relied on the Shoulda-like matchers you end up with this super brittle test framework.

You need to remove `border-style: solid` from your CSS. Why? Because `border-width` and `border-color` both have default values, so as soon as you set a border style, you're adding a border. The css `border` property is a composite object for setting all of those three properties in one go, so you're actually overriding whatever's there, anyway. For your images, set `.css('border', '10px solid black');`, for instance." CreationDate="2011-03-04T08:37:31.093" UserId="133802" />
