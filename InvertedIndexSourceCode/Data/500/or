The benefits of reusing execution plans are *usually* pretty minor -- do it when you know it counts, or when it's easy. Letting your model methods reuse statements is easy; if a method is going to loop through a bunch of things and execute the same query on each one with different data, that's a good reuse of the prepared statement. Having many instances of a model class reuse a prepared statement is hard, and probably not worth the time." CreationDate="2010-12-09T00:59:18.130" UserId="280598" />
