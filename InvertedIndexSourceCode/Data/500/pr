If the OP is going to re-create views based on nullness of columns over time, the views will not be the same and any code referencing them may break as well.

You're right about it being O(N^) in the worst case. I missed the case where `A1 = A2 = 11111`, which while rare will cause O(N^4) performance. The thing though, is that this also made me realise the output size could also be O(N^4), e.g. for `A1 = 1111122222`, `A2 = 2222211111`. I'll edit this in. Thanks for making me re-think this!"

If I understand correctly, you basically send the servers time to the client, so that the client adapts it's game time accordingly. If this happens over BT or local network one can ignore the time the sync messages require from server to lient. For example if the server is at time 123 -&gt; sends it to the client -&gt; the client may set it's own time also to 123 (the delay between recieving the server's time and updating the own time can be ignored if all happens in the same method) Is this right?"
