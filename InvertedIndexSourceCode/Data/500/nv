Sure, you can custom build a parser to do whatever you want, but there's no one generic regex you can write that will catch all valid edge cases (even in your `()` example)...

The analogy used work only on joins that join on equality operator on unique columns (or set of unique columns). This is a special case of joins (although a very important one), but it does nothing to explain how number of rows can get multiplied if the join condition is true for a certain row multiple times."

In most cases I have not needed the `reset` at all, but being able to `swap` the contents of two objects is a simple step towards the strong exception guarantee (idiom for exception guarantees: operate aside on a copy, if succeeded swap contents. The original object only gets changed through `swap` that is a no throw operation)." CreationDate="2010-11-16T08:51:51.200" UserId="36565" />
