I don't have full knowledge of every IDE out there, but I'm reasonably sure they already come with parsers (for syntax highlighting) that have already tokenized the code and can easily search for named tokens rather than treating the code as a string. While the code to tokenize code is certainly more complicated than most stand-alone regular expressions, it's conceptually simpler to scan tokenized code than it is to scan code as a set of strings. When I say &quot;software is supposed to be simple&quot;, I am referring to the ability to easily understand what is going on at a high level."
