I am reading your query carefully enough (am rushing here), then you are trying to detect that there are no zeros under allowed for particular result user id? So, if that is still true then rewriting `SELECT id FROM ... WHERE NOT EXISTS SELECT id FROM ... WHERE outter.id = inner.id AND inner.allowed = 0` (correlated subquery will bail out as soon as it sees the first 0). In reality needs to be tested on the typical data distribution and play also with indexes." CreationDate="2011-03-21T16:22:54.187" UserId="207036" />
