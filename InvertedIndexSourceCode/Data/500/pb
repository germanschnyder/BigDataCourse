It calls `operator new` instead of a function, because if it called a function then you would have to be able to define that function, which would mean making a function named `new`, but you can't do that because `new` is a keyword. Or else they **could** specify some &quot;magic&quot; name of a function to call, but that is exactly what the `operator` keyword is for - to create otherwise-impossible &quot;function names&quot;. So basically, the answer is &quot;the same reason that you override `operator +` instead of `__add__` (i.e. Python-style)&quot;." CreationDate="2010-12-20T11:48:25.453" UserId="523612" />
