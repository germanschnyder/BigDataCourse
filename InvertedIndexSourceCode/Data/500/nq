This holds up when you have 5 teachers total, but let’s say you have 10,000. Using an `int` to store the order, if you move teacher 3 to position 5, you only have to re-order three objects (3, 4, and 5). If you’re using floats, enough moves of that nature will have you going through (and sorting) all 10,000 teachers and re-assigning the index. Personally, I’d still use an integer."

The rectangle then is the simplified signal pattern. Which means that the rectangles will be rotated so that they point in the direction of the receiver node. Then i want to calculate if certain antennas are in the signal pattern/rectangle which could be disturbed by this signal. Therefore i need a method for calculating if a point is contained in a rectangle." CreationDate="2010-11-10T14:59:01.773" UserId="435036" />
