Based on your very last statement, it sounds like you want to add a CSS class, to a &quot;set&quot; of elements.  There are 2 easy ways to do this, either (A) add a class (you can have several) to all the items in the set.. e.g. &quot;group1&quot; (it doesn't have to have any styles set for it), then just use $('.group1').addClass('special');  Option (B), use .data() to add info to each element in your &quot;set&quot;, then later query every element you care about to see if it has the data set.

Normally `goto` is _none_ of those things, but every once in a while it becomes the ideal solution to your problem. And nearly every other language has special-case usages for builtin keywords like `continue` or `next` to hide what is essentially this kind of `goto` behind a nicer and more controllable visage, which is identical to what `if` and `while` and `for` statements do. `goto` here is _not bad in any way_" CreationDate="2009-10-19T04:36:12.930" UserId="60777" />
