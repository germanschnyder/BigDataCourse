I take your point nevertheless. @gmagana - I'm not worried about memory pressure, I'm worrying about latency spikes being caused by the garbage collector.  To answer your specific questions, there are typically 50-100 fields in a message (although longer messages are common elsewhere); the data is repetitive but I'm not concerned about saving memory per se, as messages are processed and disgarded very quickly."

This is good to know!  The question now is how your one definition is getting into both `main.cpp` and `system.cpp`.  By any chance, are you `#include`-ing `system.cpp` into your `main.cpp` file?  If so, that would give you exactly the behavior you're seeing here.

It's the responsibility of the code to ensure that variables contain the appropriate objects before they are used (if a variable doesn't contain an object, the only sensible option is generally a test in the form `null == variable`). As it is: `lstc.add(...)` attempts to invokes the `add` method on the *object stored in* the `lstc` variable." CreationDate="2011-02-05T22:41:41.613" UserDisplayName="user166390" />

Thirdly, checking for a change in selection by looking at the selection text isn't entirely reliable: if the user selects the same text elsewhere in the document, this will not pick that up."

I think this issue is specifically to do with having a fixed size banner under my surface view (your project only seems to use one big surface view in the layout). Can you think of any things I can try? I'm out of options right now. I've noticed that if I replace my surface view with e.g. an image view I don't get the same problem. I'm thinking it might have something to do with when the surface view is deciding what size it wants to be." CreationDate="2011-02-06T17:41:40.967" UserId="580100" />

Synchronizing it properly and leaving out `volatile` might still be no good because of the optimizations. (Unless, of course, the presence of the calls to synchronization primitives interferes with those optimizations - which I imagine it will, actually.)"

This com ref is vital for the app to work, and have to include it in the package.  So my question again is can i include the interop with the package?"

Here's what Nick Johnson wrote about it on his blog: &quot;instead of re-executing your Python executable for each request, a single Python runtime is used for multiple requests. Each request simply re-imports the main handler script for your app, which results in re-executing all the code in it, though modules loaded from it are not re-imported. As a further optimisation, if you provide a function called 'main' in your handler module, that function is executed on the second and subsequent requests, instead of re-importing the module.&quot;" CreationDate="2011-02-06T23:06:15.163" UserId="17965" />
