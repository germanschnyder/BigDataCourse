As for understanding IoC, yes, it took me a while to understand it too.

If thread/transaction A does on update on some row, then any other transaction trying to update or delete that same row will block until A commits/aborts. By contrast, two threads inserting rows into the same table won't block each other (provided they are not about to violate a uniqueness constraint). But if inserting into the table fires a trigger that then updates a shared row in some other table- now the threads are trying to update that row, and whichever gets there first blocks the other."

On 3): You don’t need to “get” the subarraylist. You have found 2 indices and can just use your existing arraylist with those. On 2) If you iterate over it to find it anyway, why not start computing the average on first-find and stop on second-find? That’ll make steps 1-4 still only one iteration, with potentially early break. That way your performance will have greatly improved even without concurrency."
