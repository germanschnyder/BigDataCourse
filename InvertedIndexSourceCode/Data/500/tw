If your problem is with the class of the output, then transform it to data.table by e.g. `as.data.frame(unclass(xtabs(V3~V1+V2, df)))`. Good luck!"

I made sure to check there was no duplicate or incorrect data in the database, so I'm putting it down to my sloppy query.&#xA;Using 'DISTINCT' does indeed for now seem to fix the issue, however I do realise that I will simply have to find another way to work around this issue.. In all honesty this is just a prototype for me to use until I have enough time, and enough foundation code to get this project really up and running.. I guess it'd be much better to deal with now, though as it will be worse in the future when this stuff is on production server..
