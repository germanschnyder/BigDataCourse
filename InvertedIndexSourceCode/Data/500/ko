I have some functors with state. I don't really think of it as state. More like a closure - it affects the `operator()` result, but `operator()` calls don't change that state. I also found http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/functors.html, with a functor `struct adder` that accumulates, updating state on each `operator()` call. I'm not sure what point I'm making here, though - maybe none. It's interesting, though." CreationDate="2010-08-01T05:11:52.673" UserId="180247" />

You make the code only more expressive for developers that use static the same way you do (an annotation or comment &quot;stateless&quot; would do nearly the same) and the reasoning about the code is not much improved because of many other possible side effects.
