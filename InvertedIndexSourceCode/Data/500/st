First, use `ofstream`'s constructor for opening the file: `ofstream f(&quot;filename&quot;);`. Then you don't need to use `f.open()` and you don't need to use `f.close()`, because the constructor and destructor will do these for you. Also, when you call `exit(1)` your local objects won't clean up. Report an error for the caller instead, and ultimately in `main()` return an error code to the operating system.

But I didn't want to complicate things any more than they already are, so I thought I'd leave that until you'd fixed up all the other problems. The correct thing is to change the parameter from `wchar_t**` to `wchar_t***` (basically, a pointer to an array of strings) but I note in your comment on another answer that you can't change the signature. In that case you can use a cast: `*Names = (wchar_t*)new wchar_t*[xxx]`. You should avoid casts when you can, but since you know it's an array of wchar_t* then the pointer to the array is the same as the pointer to its first element."

Apart from the problems within your function, you may have problems in main() and in the function that gives you the names. You really need a coherent memory management strategy, and for that you need to consider the entire environment. For example, if you use a cast like I suggest then you have to be sure that main() deletes the array correctly. This is why you should try to avoid casts - they basically tell the compiler that you're doing something dodgy but you know what you're doing and you'll ensure that it all works out OK in the end."
