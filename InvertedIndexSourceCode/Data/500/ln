So you now have two objects, one of which is pointed to by `currentCell`.  As soon as you move to the next loop iteration, you lose track of the object pointed to by `currentCell`, which is the memory leak.

In an unchecked context it correctly (1) creates a byte of value 100, (2) casts it and the 200 in byte1 to int (3) adds them resulting in 300 and then (4) converts that into a byte, discarding bits above the 8th and resulting it b having the value 44. In a checked context it correctly does steps (1) through (3) and then at (4) converts the result into a byte, resulting in an overflow exception. Both are working correctly, and both compile because the only const values ever assigned directly to a byte in this is 100 and 200" CreationDate="2010-09-01T23:36:11.727" UserId="400547" />

The ProcessValidation() method can know the type of your object (either this.GetType() or a similar call on a passed parameter), and from there it can get information for the member CompanyName and by extension the attributes decorating it. The attribute can be just a flag telling a central validator routine the exact rules to apply, or you can put the validation rule in the attribute and reflectively call some Evaluate() method on the attribute itself. Declarative validation can get messy, but that mess can be hidden behind the scenes unlike simple Validate() class members." CreationDate="2010-09-02T15:28:15.950" UserId="436376" />
