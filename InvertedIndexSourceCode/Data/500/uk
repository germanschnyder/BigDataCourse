I had previously used a SAX style parser with PHP a while ago so it was easy to understand for me. Basically your handler provides `startElement()`, `endElement()` and `characters()` callbacks. As the handler parses through the XML it will call the callbacks inturn and store your xml element data to an object or list of objects which are passed back to the calling object. IMO if your comfortable with DOM then stick with it :) Maybe someone better experienced in both designs can explain VS of the two?" CreationDate="2011-04-19T13:46:09.540" UserId="629222" />
