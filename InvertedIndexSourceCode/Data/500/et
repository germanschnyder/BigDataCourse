If they're worried they might need a platform without C++, they could write C, and get the benefit that by compiling it with `-std=c89 -pedantic` they can actually be validating it as C89, which will work in a C compiler, instead of C++, which might not. If they wanted so desperately to type &quot;new&quot; and &quot;delete&quot;, use a couple of macros (admittedly you'd need extra parentheses: `delete(new(TYPE));` instead of `delete new TYPE;`."

The issue is does the smaller of the two numbers exactly divide the larger, a simple modulus operation. For example, p(bc)=15 is a divisor of p(abcd)=210, so bc is a subset of abcd.  Adding a new set S to the existing set of N sets requires up to N modulus operations; fewer if S is a duplicate. For each existing entry E in the set of sets, if S is smaller than E, check if S divides E and ignore if it does. If S is larger than E, check whether E divides S, and remove E if it does (and add S). An array of BigNums would work." CreationDate="2009-11-22T03:15:22.950" UserId="15168" />
