In my real application the distributions were not normal. They were either Johnson or they were non-parametric (probably kernels) but I had a p function like pnorm or pjohnson. After taking the percentile I would then use the correlation matrix and fit a copula to the percentiles (now uniform between 0,1). I would then simulate correlated deviates.

There are many existing barriers to writing good libraries, such as lack of Generics and advanced OOP features.
