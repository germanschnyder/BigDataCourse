With a larger struct you simply get fewer structs into cache with any single cache page read, thereby increasing the probability that the *next* struct you want isn't in cache.

You could also have an object model in your application delegate, which is accessible to both your XML parser and your view controller. As you parse data, put it into the app delegate's object model reference. Once you're done parsing, the parser delegate tells the view controller to take over. The VC accesses the app delegate's model. If you need to persist data in between app sessions, you could parse your XML into a Core Data store. The next time you run your application, you can access the Core Data store instead of going out on the network, or merge data from CD with the XML."

Also, mine was not originally written in JavaScript, and I didn't take the time to clean it up much, so it looks a bit odd.
