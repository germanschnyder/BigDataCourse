However, if the text is only prefixed with `const`, the text is copied from Read Only Memory to the stack.  Because of this, I now always declare my text strings as `static const`."

If it's custom PCL code you will find that not all printer vendors are created equal. The biggest problem isn't supporting the language but handling all the malformed PCL code that's out there.  That's why we wouldn't embark on the task.  If you have control of the source PCL then the task isn't that bad, if you don't then it's a real issue.  That's why there are only a handful of guys out there that have solid code that does this well." CreationDate="2010-04-02T21:00:30.673" UserId="5678" />
