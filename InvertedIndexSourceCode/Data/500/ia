For example, consider: `a&lt;sizeof(int)&gt;::b&lt;c&gt;d`, where `a` is another class template with specializations, one of which defines `b` as another class template, and the second one defines `b` as enum member. Depending on which specialization is picked (i.e. on size of `int`), the whole thing is either a declaration of variable `d`: `a&lt;sizeof(int)&gt;::b&lt;c&gt;d` - or it is an expression: `a&lt;sizeof(int)&gt;::b &lt; c &gt; d`.
