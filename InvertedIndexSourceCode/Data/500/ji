Sebastian: thanks re dic.get(i) - i used \__getitem__ because i was looking for the _exact_ fn equivalent of `dict[i]` and i know `dict.get()` returns `None` when item is not found while `[]` throws exception. Except there is no reason why i should prefer one over the other - trying to append `None` to a list will cause exception too, so simplest - get - wins. re itertools.chain - i don't know itertools (yet), will look into it - seems convenient!"
