Thanks for the links, but I'm quite aware of the differences.  The hair-splitting doesn't seem helpful.  If it makes you happy, though, keep on posting.  In spite of my confusion over the `lines=` with and without `list`, I have one and only one point.  That is, I prefer the function notation over the expression.  That's all. I was confused by your point.  I am no longer confused.  I still have nothing much to say.  I have a preference of function over expression.  That's all there is."

Also, from what you described, it seems there is no sys.stdin usage for a GUI, However, the sys.stdout sometimes could be useful to print out the information on a textctrl widget.
