Perhaps, for further clarification, you could show how an exact decimal value, such as 0.4, maps to binary and we have all three cases. +1" CreationDate="2011-03-02T08:52:01.350" UserId="501673" />

It may not be a bad idea to store the build files with your project. This gives you two advantages: 1) You can now build the project outside of Eclipse on you Linux box. You only need the JDK and Ant or Maven installed and configured. 2) You can tell Eclipse to run your Ant scripts or Maven scripts(if you have m2eclipse plugin installed). Now you are building the same, it is just that you are using Eclipse to kick it off. Makes the most sense to me as the way to go for both systems."
