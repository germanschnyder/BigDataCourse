Let's say we wanted to shuffle the list `{1, 2, 3}`, and the OrderBy implementation decided to compare `1` vs. `2`, and then `1` vs `3`. It would call the delegate, which would call `NewGuid`, but when it wanted to compare `1` against two different numbers, would it call `NewGuid` only once, or multiple times? If it calls multiple times, then this does not produce a good shuffle, and the final order depends greatly on the implementation of OrderBy."
