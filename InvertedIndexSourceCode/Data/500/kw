My point is that when you can define RI constraints in a relational database, you don't have to worry about whether your documents contain broken references.  Performing that enforcement in the app is insufficient, because apps can have bugs.  Maybe another developer is writing his own app to access your same data, and he doesn't know which constraints to implement.  So you can never be sure your data has integrity unless the database is in charge of enforcement.  And that also means you need to define a schema."
