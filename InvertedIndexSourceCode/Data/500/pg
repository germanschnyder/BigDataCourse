In the second example, the compiler/interpreter is seeing scientific notation, and forcing a type of float, resulting in the equation being true only for a CAST AS of float.

ICriteria seems to be a model type object containing data but unrelated to the action taken on the critera. If code is added to ICriteria pertaining to the actions taken upon it, then the developer has locked ICriteria to only be used within their specific world. ICriteria  can be designed so that it can be used in other places and different actions could occur based on where in the program ICriteria is used. You really dont want to put Controller code in Model code." CreationDate="2010-12-24T18:25:50.593" UserId="553308" />

  <row Id="4970164" PostId="4521779" Score="0" Text="Just to let you know: I have investigated further and found a way that _should_ work, but doesn't in practice:  From FlashPlayer 10 on, TextArea, as all other subclasses of InteractiveObject should fire a &quot;paste&quot; event, on which you can supposedly access the clipboard by calling Clipboard.generalClipboard.getData().  You could, then, process the content in the way described above.  Like I said, this should work, according to the Flash API.  The compiler even lets you code it.  The only problem is, the event never actually gets fired, and the clipboard can't be accessed on any other event." CreationDate="2010-12-26T22:57:05.170" UserId="547122" />
