The big inefficiency is not that each item is being copied multiple times to get it into the array; that's unfortunate but inevitable. The big inefficiency is that the ToArray extension method can't do any smart optimizations on the conversion to array because the result of the cast is an enumeration of *unknown size*. In your code, the size of the final array is determined up front, so there is no need to reallocate any arrays along the way.
