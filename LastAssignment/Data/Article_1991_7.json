Yet there is not one organization with the mandate and expertise to exercise leadership on inter-American trade issues. This is a vacuum that now should be filled by the governments of the Americas. President Bush set off a flurry of activity a year ago, when he put forth the vision of a Western Hemisphere free-trade area. Country after country in Latin America declared interest in free trade with the United States -- and six have signed bilateral or multilateral \"framework agreements\" with Washington providing for regular discussion on key issues. The proposal has also reinvigorated existing trade pacts throughout Latin America; prompted Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay to work toward a common market, and spurred other nations to begin free-trade talks. All this activity surely will accelerate now that fast-track authority for United States trade negotiations has been renewed.","abstract":null,"print_page":"13","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Make the Free-Trade Vision a Reality","kicker":"FORUM"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"LATIN AMERICA"},{"name":"glocations","value":"UNITED STATES"},{"name":"subject","value":"INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND WORLD MARKET"}],"pub_date":"1991-06-30T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Financial Desk","section_name":"Business","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"firstname":"Richard","middlename":"E.","lastname":"FEINBERG","rank":1,"role":"reported","organization":""},{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":2}],"original":"By RICHARD E.

LeMond, the three-time winner, who started the day in first place, finished 30th in the 161-mile stage from Arras to the port city of Le Havre. Sean Kelly of Ireland moved from third to second place over all. Marie moved out early and built a 22-minute margin that was whittled to less than two minutes by the end of the leg. Marie started his move with 145 miles left in the stage. The longest breakaway in the event's history was 157 miles by Albert Bourlon of France in 1947. At the end, Marie's margin and 32 seconds of bonuses gave him a lead of 1 minute 4 seconds over Kelly, who placed fourth in the stage behind Remig Stumpf of Germany and Djamolidine Abdoujapalov of the Soviet Union. Abdoujapalov, riding for Carrera, was tied for third with LeMond, 1:07 behind Marie. The stage started without Wednesday's leader, Rolf Sorensen of Denmark, who was forced to withdraw after breaking his collarbone in a fall. LeMond, who inherited the lead, refused to wear the yellow jersey during the stage out of respect for Sorensen, who flew to a sports clinic in Italy for surgery. Marie won the prologue and had the yellow jersey during the first stage, but gave it up to LeMond, who had gained enough bonus seconds to move into first place. LeMond subsequently turned the symbolic jersey over to Sorensen after the team time trial Sunday.
