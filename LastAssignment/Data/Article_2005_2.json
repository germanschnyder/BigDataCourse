The sentry has a platinum wig, rosy lips and a white dress billowing above a simulated subway grate: Marilyn Monroe at her Pop Art pinnacle. Hard not to crack a smile. Mr. Cipriani, who with a partner, Steven C. Witkoff, won a protracted duel last week against a team fronted by Roland A. Betts, President Bush's bosom buddy and a co-creator of Chelsea Piers, for the development rights to Pier 57 at 15th Street, is certainly smiling. As opposed to gloating, which he deems unmanly. Still, he admits it felt sweet to see his $154 million Italianate project, the Leonardo at Pier 57, emerge victorious from an 18-month skirmish during which Chelsea Piers backers disparaged the Leonardo's 80,000-square-foot banquet hall, which will be the city's largest, and circulated testimony from a mob turncoat at Peter Gotti's trial linking Mr. Cipriani to the payment of a $120,000 bribe to settle a union dispute.","abstract":null,"print_page":"4","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"url":"images\/2005\/04\/15\/nyregion\/lives.75.jpg","subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"hasthumbnail":"Y","thumbnailheight":75,"thumbnail":"images\/2005\/04\/15\/nyregion\/lives.75.jpg"},"type":"image","height":75},{"height":55,"subtype":"tiny_thumb","legacy":{"tinythumbwidth":55,"tinythumbheight":55,"hastinythumb":"Y"},"type":"image","width":55}],"headline":{"main":"Savoring the Good Life, and Giving Others a Taste","kicker":"PUBLIC LIVES"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"CIPRIANI, GIUSEPPE"}],"pub_date":"2005-04-15T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Metropolitan Desk","section_name":"New York and Region","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Robin","lastname":"FINN"}],"original":"By ROBIN FINN"},"type_of_material":"Biography","_id":"4fd24abd8eb7c8105d7e8d5c","word_count":919},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2005\/04\/17\/arts\/music\/17play.html","snippet":"Brazilian sounds influence new recordings by the Uruguayan singer-songwriter Jorge Drexler and the American jazz pianist Cliff Korman.","lead_paragraph":"Jorge Drexler A deeply talented Uruguayan singer-songwriter in his early 40's, Mr. Drexler writes songs that are contained by craft but pull toward longing. He became better known after his song ''Al Otro Lado Del R\u00edo'' (''The Other Side of the River'') appeared on the ''Motorcycle Diaries'' soundtrack and won an the Academy Award this year. His seventh album, ''Eco,'' which includes that beautiful song, brings some Brazilians to mind. He sings with Caetano Veloso's alto and soft-voiced control, and the record also bears the influence of the singer-songwriter Lenine. The light acoustic funk of Mr. Drexler's band has been carefully cropped and chopped through subtle electronic postproduction. All that and excellent lyrics, too, for Spanish readers: the lines fold into one another so that you must consider the whole song at a run. Like this, an approximate translation from ''Todo Se Transforma'' (''Everything Is Changed'') : ''Your kiss became heat\/After heat, movement,\/Then a drop of sweat\/Which became steam, then wind\/That in a little corner of La Rioja\/Moved the vane of the windmill\/While trampled was the wine\/which was drunk by your red mouth.'' Cliff Korman and the Brazilian Tinge Cliff Korman, an American jazz pianist who has spent a great deal of time in Brazil over the last 20 years, has composed and recorded a long-form suite, ''Migrations'' (Planet Arts). One of Mr. Korman's areas of expertise is choro, a complex, jazzlike music that started in Brazil in the late 19th century and that features a lot of counterpoint and improvisation. At this point, choro is part of the past, and a vehicle for a modern jazz composer's imagination: a way to go backward and forward at the same time. Mr. Korman has used bits of a piece written in 1899 by the composer Francisca Gonzaga and woven them into his original music the way dreams mix the real and the invented; with groups that expand and contract in size, the mood shifts from carnival to classical to jazz. (Available at www.planetarts.org.) Mice Parade Mostly one guy working in a home studio -- Adam Pierce, formerly of the Swirlies and the Dylan Group -- Mice Parade makes pleasant headphone records that have more and more melody lodged in them. ''Bem-Vinda Vontade'' (''Welcome Will''), his fourth album (Bubblecore), also includes a few friends, like the singer Kristin Anna Valtysdottir, from the Icelandic band Mum, and the drummer Doug Scharin of the band HiM. Don't be fooled by the Portuguese title; this is American bedroom-auteur indie rock par excellence. It presents many ideas about how to avoid the clich\u00e9s of his genre; but instead of getting there with lyrics and attitude, he gets there with instrumental ideas. Often it comes down to guitars and drums: distorted guitar power chords with light, skittering drumming, or a Spanish acoustic guitar with heavier-bottomed rock drumming. The Duhks This young band from Winnipeg plays bluegrass as well as all kinds of old-time music: French-Canadian folk stomps, Scotch-Irish reels and gospel. The band's first album, ''The Duhks,'' has been released by Sugar Hill. Like the roots-Americana groups Nickel Creek and Ollabelle, this band has pop aspirations, not that I had any great desire to hear an acoustic version of Sting's ''Love Is the Seventh Wave.'' But their trawling in traditional music feels much more exciting, with strong but unvirtuosic voices, energetic ensemble playing and various percussion instruments that have absolutely nothing to do with the traditions they're dipping into. (The Duhks will perform next Saturday at Joe's Pub.) Paul Desmond The alto saxophonist with the edgeless, spring-water sound in Dave Brubeck's quartet, Desmond was one of those jazz mysteries who pulled the covers around him so tightly -- a compulsive privacy disguised as hipsterism -- it was hard to discern the complete person. As a young man he was a humor writer influenced by Thurber and Perelman, but he found a path of lesser resistance in jazz. He balanced these two interests uneasily and similarly compartmentalized his life and relationships. In ''Take Five: The Public and Private Lives of Paul Desmond'' (Parkside Publications), the writer Doug Ramsey, the saxophonist's friend for 20 years before Desmond's death in 1977, constructs that full person as well as digging out much more of his writing than was known. A major piece of jazz scholarship, the book cuts no corners: it reprints a five-page letter to the 9-year-old Desmond written by his father, at a time when his mother's nervous condition was so bad that young Paul had to be sent across the country to stay with cousins in Westchester County, in New York, and an even longer letter from the 24-year-old Desmond to his father about his anxieties over whether to start playing like Charlie Parker. (He didn't, and for the sake of his music the anxieties were apparently worth having.) If you're not ready to be engulfed in this vulnerable, cerebral, postwar New York world, start by listening to Desmond's great 1964 album, ''Easy Living,'' on Bluebird.","abstract":"Ben Ratliff reviews some recent CD's; photos (S)","print_page":"24","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"From Uruguay or America, That Touch of Brazil","kicker":"MUSIC: PLAYLIST"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"DESMOND, PAUL"},{"name":"subject","value":"ROCK MUSIC"},{"name":"subject","value":"RECORDINGS (AUDIO)"},{"name":"subject","value":"MUSIC"},{"name":"subject","value":"REVIEWS"},{"name":"subject","value":"JAZZ"}],"pub_date":"2005-04-17T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Arts and Leisure Desk","section_name":"Arts","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Ben","lastname":"Ratliff"}],"original":"By Ben Ratliff"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd2a6508eb7c8105d88e6fe","word_count":830},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2005\/04\/19\/sports\/soccer\/19soccer.html","snippet":"\"Hooligans,\" winner of an award at the South by Southwest Film Festival and part of the TriBeCa Film Festival, is one of several new soccer movies.","lead_paragraph":"Whether it is in Italy, England, Germany or nearly anywhere else in the world, hooliganism is the disfigured face of soccer, the beautiful game.
