The decline, while large, still leaves Mexico's oil more costly than spot market oil, showing the severity of the downward pressure on prices. Petroleum prices dropped sharply in New York today as traders looked ahead pessimistically to an OPEC meeting on Monday. The Mexican cut is retroactive to Jan. 1. For the American market, the price of a barrel of the premium Isthmus grade of crude was lowered to $21.70, from $26.25. The price of the cheaper Mayan crude went to $19.50, from $22.","abstract":null,"print_page":"22","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"MEXICO TRIMS PRICE OF ITS CRUDE"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"MEXICO"},{"name":"organizations","value":"ORGANIZATION OF PETROLEUM EXPORTING COUNTRIES"},{"name":"subject","value":"PRICES"},{"name":"subject","value":"OIL (PETROLEUM) AND GASOLINE"}],"pub_date":"1986-02-01T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Financial Desk","section_name":"Business","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"William","rank":1,"lastname":"STOCKTON"},{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":2}],"original":"By WILLIAM STOCKTON, Special to the New York Times"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd160d18eb7c8105d64a949","word_count":682},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1986\/02\/09\/magazine\/the-tyranny-of-the-yale-critics.html","snippet":"THE ENGLISH department at Yale used to resemble a sort of English country estate.

It included a great house of many wings and rooms (the Elizabethan Pavilion, the Metaphysical Poets Billiard Parlor, the T. S. Eliot Chapel and so forth) and, normally, one entered this house via certain well-marked paths and avenues that ran through a spacious park. The park looked as though Nature had placed it there, but it was actually quite artificial, a typical landscape a l'anglais. Now and then a dewy-eyed deer or tame peacock would walk past. Everything was in order. And despite the rival claims of such ancient estates as Oxford and Cambridge, and despite the genius of Harvard and a few other houses, Yale's English department was in many ways the envy of the English-speaking world. But a dense jungle has grown up around this house of literature, and the normal route these days into the Shelley Bedchamber isn't up the stairs but through the window, by liana. The estate is choked with new theoretical plants and weird new beasts of criticism, many of them French - as if a tropical French colony, a Paris with snakes, had sprung up from the turf. Some fear the jungle also shields a guerrilla camp from which armed nihilists have been launching raids on the academic countryside.","abstract":null,"print_page":"20","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"THE TYRANNY OF THE YALE CRITICS"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"BLOOM, HAROLD"},{"name":"persons","value":"HARTMAN, GEOFFREY H"},{"name":"persons","value":"MILLER, J HILLIS"},{"name":"persons","value":"DERRIDA, JACQUES"},{"name":"organizations","value":"YALE UNIVERSITY"},{"name":"subject","value":"BOOKS AND LITERATURE"}],"pub_date":"1986-02-09T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Magazine Desk","section_name":"Magazine; Books","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Colin","rank":1,"lastname":"Campbell"}],"original":"By Colin Campbell; Colin Campbell is a New York Times reporter"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd160d38eb7c8105d64ab78","word_count":6742},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1986\/02\/11\/opinion\/in-the-nation-the-last-chance.html","snippet":"Foreign ministers of the most important Latin American nations met yesterday in Washington with George Shultz in what may have been the last chance to move the Reagan Administration away from a military and toward a negotiated settlement in Central...","lead_paragraph":"Foreign ministers of the most important Latin American nations met yesterday in Washington with George Shultz in what may have been the last chance to move the Reagan Administration away from a military and toward a negotiated settlement in Central America. Neither the Secretary of State nor President Reagan has shown the slightest interest in making such a shift, and the Administration may try, informed sources believe, to portray the Latin ministers as supporting an important element of Administration policy. The issue: Which should come first, a resumption of United States talks with the Sandinista Government of Nicaragua, or negotiations between the Sandinistas and the political leaders of the United States-supported ''contras,'' who seek to take power in Managua? The Reagan Administration insists that it will not resume direct talks with the Sandinistas until they ''open a dialogue'' with the contra leaders - a step the Sandinistas say they will not take. United States-Nicaraguan talks that began in 1984 were broken off last year, and since Nov. 1 the two Governments have not even been talking about the possibility of reopening direct contact.","abstract":null,"print_page":"31","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"The Last Chance?","kicker":"IN THE NATION"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"REAGAN, RONALD WILSON"},{"name":"persons","value":"SHULTZ, GEORGE PRATT"},{"name":"glocations","value":"NICARAGUA"},{"name":"glocations","value":"LATIN AMERICA"},{"name":"subject","value":"UNITED STATES INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS"},{"name":"subject","value":"INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS"},{"name":"subject","value":"MILITARY STRATEGY AND TACTICS"},{"name":"subject","value":"CIVIL WAR AND GUERRILLA WARFARE"},{"name":"subject","value":"UNITED STATES ARMAMENT AND DEFENSE"}],"pub_date":"1986-02-11T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Editorial Desk","section_name":"Opinion","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Tom","rank":1,"lastname":"Wicker"}],"original":"By Tom Wicker"},"type_of_material":"Op-Ed","_id":"4fd156578eb7c8105d63ac59","word_count":694},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1986\/02\/11\/world\/latin-ministers-urge-us-to-halt-aid-to-contras.html","snippet":"Eight Latin American foreign ministers met today with Secretary of State George P.

Congress later made some exceptions for programs to combat terrorism, and the Reagan Administration seems intent on making the most of them. ''Our support for democratic development in Latin America must be highlighted by our support to counterterrorism,'' James H. Michel, a Deputy Assistant Secretary of State, said in November. The Administration is training some police units in the region; the Central Intelligence Agency and military advisers have worked with military police counterterrorism units in El Salvador, and civilian police units in Costa Rica have been instructed in counterinsurgency, bomb-detection and airport security methods. The effort has prompted accusations reminiscent of the 1970's. In particular, there have been objections to C.I.A.-assisted units of Government security forces in Honduras, who were said to have killed suspected leftists.","abstract":null,"print_page":"2","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Latin American Police Get Some Pointers From Washington"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"REAGAN, RONALD WILSON"},{"name":"subject","value":"TERRORISM"},{"name":"subject","value":"POLICE"}],"pub_date":"1986-02-16T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Week in Review Desk","section_name":"Week in Review","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"James","rank":1,"lastname":"LeMOYNE"}],"original":"By JAMES LeMOYNE"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd160d58eb7c8105d64ac97","word_count":751},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1986\/02\/18\/opinion\/l-let-s-choose-peace-over-war-in-nicaragua-733686.html","snippet":"To the Editor:   Over the last four years we have repeatedly called for an end to aid to the United States-backed counterrevolutionary forces (known as contras), who seek to overthrow the Government of Nicaragua.
