A U.S. oilman here at a time of nationalist fervor, he was the former chief geologist for Standard Oil Company of New Jersey whom Brazil hired to find its oil reserves. The year was 1954. Petrobras, the newly created national oil company, put the blunt, Indiana-born Link to work creating Brazil's oil exploration sector. Six long years ensued before he issued his polemical ''Link Report,'' describing tepid results. For Brazil to meet its oil needs, he recommended going offshore or abroad.","abstract":"Brazil's booming offshore oil development, centered on national oil company Petrobras, is largest industrial undertaking in country's history; is on pace to make Brazil world's 4th-largest oil producer by 2020's; expansion can be tied to discovery of vast offshore reserves, as well as technological advances granting access to previously untappable oil.
