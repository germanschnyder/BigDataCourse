This documentary by Edet Belzberg follows the fervently patriotic Sgt. First Class Clay Usie as he works closely with four recruits in Houma, La., a small Cajun town of shrimpers and oil riggers near New Orleans, finishing their senior year of high school and preparing for basic training. Lauren, above, a 17-year-old from a poor background, sees the military as the best way to pay for college and become an artist. Bobby, 18, an honor student with a bright future, decides to join the Army despite the disapproval of his father, a veteran. ''He's made the decision,'' his father says. ''I don't know that any 18-year-old can really understand that the end of his life could be around the corner in Iraq.'' 7 A.M.
