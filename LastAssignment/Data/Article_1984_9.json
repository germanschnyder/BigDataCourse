If Gen. Gregorio Alvarez surrenders power as planned on March 1, Uruguay will become the eighth nation in the region to switch from military to civilian rule since 1980. Early returns from Montevideo gave a firm lead to the center-right Colorado Party and its presidential candidate, Julio Maria Sanguinetti, a 48- year-old lawyer and journalist, who was also doing better than expected in the interior. The voting took place today in a mood of great enthusiasm, with the colors of the three main parties visible everywhere in the capital. About 630,000 of the 2.2 million eligible voters were going to the polls for the first time, and a large turnout was reported.","abstract":null,"print_page":"1","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"JUBILANT URUGUAYANS ELECT CIVILIAN LEADERS"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"SANGUINETTI, JULIO MARIA"},{"name":"glocations","value":"URUGUAY"},{"name":"subject","value":"POLITICS AND GOVERNMENT (1983)"},{"name":"subject","value":"ELECTIONS"}],"pub_date":"1984-11-26T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Foreign Desk","section_name":"World; Front Page","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Alan","rank":1,"lastname":"RIDING"},{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":2}],"original":"By ALAN RIDING, Special to the New York Times"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd13d6d8eb7c8105d613c0a","word_count":807},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1984\/11\/27\/world\/man-in-the-news-peacemaker-for-uruaguay.html","snippet":"In the last 11 years, while thousands of Uruguyans were jailed and tens of thousands more were forced into exile, Julio Maria Sanguinetti avoided a confrontation with the military regime, convinced that it could be coaxed - but never forced - out of...","lead_paragraph":"In the last 11 years, while thousands of Uruguyans were jailed and tens of thousands more were forced into exile, Julio Maria Sanguinetti avoided a confrontation with the military regime, convinced that it could be coaxed - but never forced - out of office.

As his victory became apparent early today, Julio Maria Sanguinetti, a 48-year-old lawyer who was nominated by the Colorado Party, called on the defeated candidates and parties in the election Sunday to help him form ''a Government of national understanding.'' He promised to seek the broadest possible consensus ''so that this Government can consolidate Uruguayan democracy and forever bury the past.''

Democracy, long preferred by inhabitants of the region, seemed headed for extinction. Then suddenly the trend changed. On Sunday Uruguay became the eighth Latin American country to elect a civilian President since 1980 and Brazil and Guatemala should follow suit next year. Today only Chile, Paraguay and Haiti are still firmly in the grip of rightist dictators. The Reagan Administration has claimed partial credit for this turnaround. Excluding events preceding the United States invasion of Grenada, no civilian Government was ousted in the region during the President's first term, while Vice President Bush attended the inaugurations of a succession of newly elected governments.","abstract":null,"print_page":"3","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"DEMOCRACY IN FLOWER","kicker":"A LATIN SPRING"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"REAGAN, RONALD WILSON"},{"name":"glocations","value":"LATIN AMERICA"},{"name":"subject","value":"DEMOCRACY (THEORY AND PHILOSOPHY)"},{"name":"subject","value":"UNITED STATES INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS"},{"name":"subject","value":"INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS"},{"name":"subject","value":"ARMAMENT, DEFENSE AND MILITARY FORCES"},{"name":"subject","value":"POLITICS AND GOVERNMENT (1983)"},{"name":"subject","value":"ELECTIONS"}],"pub_date":"1984-11-29T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Foreign Desk","section_name":"World; Washington","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Alan","rank":1,"lastname":"RIDING"}],"original":"By ALAN RIDING"},"type_of_material":"An Analysis","_id":"4fd13d738eb7c8105d614128","word_count":949}]},"status":"OK","copyright":"Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
