Mr. Silva, whom Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan cited as the architect of the $500 million loan agreement for Argentina, said he expected Argentina to meet the 30-day repayment deadline that the participants in the agreement reported Saturday. If not, however, the deadline can be stretched for 60 days, he said. He also emphasized the significance of four debtor nations' contributing to assist a fifth.","abstract":null,"print_page":"1","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"SILVA: ARCHITECT OF DEBT PLAN"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"SILVA HERZOG, JESUS"},{"name":"persons","value":"REGAN, DONALD T"},{"name":"glocations","value":"ARGENTINA"},{"name":"glocations","value":"MEXICO"},{"name":"subject","value":"CREDIT"},{"name":"subject","value":"ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND TRENDS"}],"pub_date":"1984-04-03T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Financial Desk","section_name":"Business","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"firstname":"Peter","middlename":"T.","lastname":"KILBORN","rank":1,"role":"reported","organization":""}],"original":"By PETER T.

Although the country is listed as having the third-largest foreign debt in the developing world, after Brazil and Mexico, Argentina's previous military regime apparently kept no central records and left behind what Government officials and financial experts have described as an ''administrative nightmare.'' ''We still don't know the debt - there were no registers in the central bank,'' said Bernardo Grinspun, Argentina's Economics Minister, before leaving Friday night for the United States for crucial debt talks with the International Monetary Fund. ''With most loans,'' Mr. Grinspun said, ''we could not identify the purpose, the amount, the interest or the grace period.''","abstract":null,"print_page":"1","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"ARGENTINA UNSURE HOW MUCH DEBT IS"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"ARGENTINA"},{"name":"subject","value":"DEFAULTING"},{"name":"subject","value":"ARMAMENT, DEFENSE AND MILITARY FORCES"},{"name":"subject","value":"BUREAUCRATIC RED TAPE"},{"name":"subject","value":"FINANCES"},{"name":"subject","value":"POLITICS AND GOVERNMENT (1983)"},{"name":"subject","value":"CREDIT"},{"name":"subject","value":"ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND TRENDS"}],"pub_date":"1984-04-09T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Financial Desk","section_name":"Front Page; Business","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Marlise","rank":1,"lastname":"SIMONS"},{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":2}],"original":"By MARLISE SIMONS, Special to the New York Times"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd137078eb7c8105d6093c6","word_count":1006},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1984\/04\/16\/world\/uruguay-government-closes-two-opposition-publications.html","snippet":"Uruguay's military Government has closed the opposition newspaper Cinco Dias and magazine Frente Amplia, the editor of Cinco Dias said Saturday.

In Uruguay, for example, why else has Hiber Conteris been denied a fair trial in open court? A 50- year-old Methodist minister, Mr. Conteris, was arrested in 1976 on his return from a church conference in Europe.
