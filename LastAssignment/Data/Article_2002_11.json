In this case, he has adapted Rolf Hochhuth's 1963 play ''The Deputy,'' in which Pope Pius XII is portrayed as refusing to act on information about the Holocaust. Both the play and the movie are based on the true story of a dissident SS officer who revealed de-tails of the Nazi gas chambers to the Vatican. What particularly links this English-language movie to the Greek-born Mr. Costa-Gavras's other works is its combination of political thriller and moral debate. He frequently focuses on the moral choices faced by civilized people during moments of political repression. Even more pertinently, he poses the question: How would we act in the same circumstances? His aim may be to denounce dictatorships of left and right, but he recognizes that individuals are often as cowardly as they are heroic.","abstract":"Article on some of films of Costa-Gavras's focuses on his upcoming film Amen, adapted from Rolf Hochhuth's 1963 play The Deputy, in which Pope Pius XII is portrayed as refusing to act on information about Holocaust; photo (M)","print_page":"40","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Fashioning Thrillers From Dark Chapters of History and Difficult Choices","kicker":"HOLIDAY MOVIES"},"keywords":[{"name":"creative_works","value":"DEPUTY, THE (PLAY)"},{"name":"creative_works","value":"AMEN (MOVIE)"},{"name":"persons","value":"PIUS XII"},{"name":"persons","value":"COSTA-GAVRAS, CONSTANTIN"},{"name":"persons","value":"HOCHHUTH, ROLF"},{"name":"organizations","value":"ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH"},{"name":"subject","value":"MOTION PICTURES"},{"name":"subject","value":"NAZI POLICIES TOWARD JEWS AND MINORITIES"},{"name":"subject","value":"THEATER"}],"pub_date":"2002-11-03T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Arts and Leisure Desk","section_name":"Movies; Arts; Theater","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Alan","rank":1,"lastname":"RIDING"}],"original":"By ALAN RIDING"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd2396c8eb7c8105d7cd290","word_count":322},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2002\/11\/24\/world\/south-american-trading-bloc-frees-movement-of-its-people.html","snippet":"In an important step toward regional integration, the six member nations of the South American common market have approved a plan that will allow their 250 million people to live and work in any other member country and be granted the same rights as...","lead_paragraph":"In an important step toward regional integration, the six member nations of the South American common market have approved a plan that will allow their 250 million people to live and work in any other member country and be granted the same rights as the citizens of those nations.
