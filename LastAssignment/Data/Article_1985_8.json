Shultz said today that the United States had no intention of resuming direct negotiations with Nicaragua in the context of the peace initiative by Panama, Colombia, Mexico and Venezuela. At a meeting of the Organization of American States here, Mr. Shultz said past talks had resulted in a Nicaraguan effort ''to undermine'' the so-called Contadora peace process, ''so we don't intend to go back to that.'' He spoke with reporters after conferring with the Foreign Ministers of Mexico, Colombia, Venezuela and Panama, the four Contadora Group nations. Mr. Shultz said he had heard nothing to suggest ''Nicaragua's willingness to engage in the kind of internal reconciliation that we feel is an essential attribute to any dialogue we might have with them.''","abstract":null,"print_page":"3","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"U.S. RULES OUT NEW NICARAGUA TALKS"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"SHULTZ, GEORGE PRATT"},{"name":"glocations","value":"NICARAGUA"},{"name":"glocations","value":"VENEZUELA"},{"name":"glocations","value":"COLOMBIA"},{"name":"glocations","value":"PANAMA"},{"name":"glocations","value":"MEXICO"},{"name":"organizations","value":"ORGANIZATION OF AMERCIAN STATES"},{"name":"subject","value":"UNITED STATES INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS"},{"name":"subject","value":"INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS"},{"name":"subject","value":"CIVIL WAR AND GUERRILLA WARFARE"}],"pub_date":"1985-12-03T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Foreign Desk","section_name":"World; Washington","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Alan","rank":1,"lastname":"RIDING"},{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":2}],"original":"By ALAN RIDING, Special to the New York Times"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd149988eb7c8105d6269f2","word_count":615},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1985\/12\/04\/world\/8-latin-countries-call-for-us-nicaraguan-talks.html","snippet":"Eight Latin American nations began a new diplomatic effort today to persuade the Reagan Administration to resume direct negotiations with Nicaragua.

As the recommisioned World War II battleship sails down the harbor, about 35 war vessels will fire 21-gun salutes.

President Raul Alfonsin's decision to bring his military predecessors to trial on charges of human rights violations was a rare breach of a longstanding tradition by which rulers in Latin America may be deposed and discredited, but not punished. The underlying rationale could be summarized as, ''Judge not, lest ye be judged.'' But the Argentine trial and convictions, sources in the region said, served notice to military officers who now hold power and to officers who might one day be tempted to seize it: they may be held to account for their actions.","abstract":null,"print_page":"15","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"LATIN MILITARY PUT ONNOTICE BY JUNTA TRIAL"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"ALFONSIN, RAUL"},{"name":"glocations","value":"LATIN AMERICA"},{"name":"glocations","value":"ARGENTINA"},{"name":"subject","value":"ARMAMENT, DEFENSE AND MILITARY FORCES"},{"name":"subject","value":"TRIALS"},{"name":"subject","value":"FREEDOM AND HUMAN RIGHTS"}],"pub_date":"1985-12-15T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Foreign Desk","section_name":"World","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Lydia","rank":1,"lastname":"CHAVEZ"},{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":2}],"original":"By LYDIA CHAVEZ, Special to the New York Times"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd149998eb7c8105d626aae","word_count":842},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1985\/12\/16\/business\/imf-says-banks-back-baker-plan.html","snippet":"Commercial banks holding 90 percent of loans to developing countries have thrown their support behind an American proposal that they increase their lending to the third world by $20 billion over three years as their contribution to easing the debt...","lead_paragraph":"Commercial banks holding 90 percent of loans to developing countries have thrown their support behind an American proposal that they increase their lending to the third world by $20 billion over three years as their contribution to easing the debt crisis.

Baker 3d. With the messages of support that the two financial institutions said they had now received from the banks, the debt strategy has moved into a new phase.
