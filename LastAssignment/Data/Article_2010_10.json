Argentina won Group B with the maximum nine points and will face Mexico in the round of 16 on Sunday. Argentina needed only to avoid a heavy defeat to progress. Coach Diego Maradona made seven changes to the team that beat South Korea 4-1 last Saturday. He handed the captain's armband to Lionel Messi, who gave a commanding midfield performance alongside the veteran Juan Sebastian Veron.","abstract":"Soccer Roundup; Argentina defeats Greece, 2-0, to finish in first place in World Cup Group B; photo (M)","print_page":"13","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Perfect Argentina Makes Maradona Look Like a Genius","kicker":"GOAL"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"SOUTH AFRICA"},{"name":"glocations","value":"GREECE"},{"name":"glocations","value":"ARGENTINA"},{"name":"subject","value":"WORLD CUP (SOCCER)"},{"name":"subject","value":"SOCCER"}],"pub_date":"2010-06-23T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Sports Desk","section_name":"Sports","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Duncan","lastname":"IRVING"}],"original":"By DUNCAN IRVING"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd29ea88eb7c8105d8816d5","word_count":2366},{"web_url":"http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/fullpage.html?res=9D06E2DC1439F930A15755C0A9669D8B63","snippet":"In a stirring match worthy of dredging tears from both sides by its conclusion, South Korea found its dream while Nigeria exited the World Cup with some fresh, near-miss nightmares.

The Taeguk Warriors, solidifying the credentials they built with a brazen run to the semifinals in the 2002 World Cup in South Korea and Japan, reached their first knockout stage of a World Cup on foreign soil when they rebounded from a 1-0 deficit, took a 2-1 lead, watched Nigeria match them at 2-2 on a penalty in the 69th minute, then held on with heaving lungs.
