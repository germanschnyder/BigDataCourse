(National Geographic) HITLER'S SUICIDE SHIP This is the story of one of Hitler's prized warships, the Admiral Graf Spee, above, which was blown up by its own captain, Hans Langsdorff, in December 1939 after a battle with British ships off the coast of Uruguay. Though the Graf Spee was more technologically advanced and had heavier artillery, Langsdorff tried to win by evading opponents instead of attacking. He then committed suicide. ''Gestapo Chief,'' at 9, follows the husband-and-wife team Serge and Beate Klarsfeld as they search for Nazis and try to bring them to justice. Kurt Lischka, once the Gestapo chief in Paris and responsible for the deaths of tens of thousands of Jews, was allowed to live openly in West Germany instead of paying for his crimes. The couple shadowed Lischka for almost nine years and eventually planned a kidnapping that ended in the couple's arrest in 1974. On ''Hunting Hitler's Generals,'' at 10, Allied operatives are ordered to capture or kill Gen. Erwin Rommel in his Libyan desert headquarters. Something went horribly wrong during the mission, and what really happened is still a mystery. 8 P.M.
