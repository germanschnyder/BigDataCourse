This is the wittiest, most lyrical and colorful free summer show the Puerto Rican Traveling Theater and Pregones Theater have ever presented in their annual series. This year it is running in parks in all five boroughs of the city and at several New Jersey sites, through Aug. 29. This operatic comedy has a distinctly Uruguayan spirit. The playwright, Hugo Bardallo, spices a medieval folk tale with dialogue so funny and subtle that he packs into one hour more humor and irony than would seem possible. He is an honored master of murga, a Mardi Gras theatrical genre involving commedia dell'arte, song, dance, music based on Latin American and African rhythms thrummed out on drums and cymbals, and high-pitched choruses that seem to be sung, with hilarious effect, directly through the nose.","abstract":"D J R Bruckner reviews Puerto Rican Traveling Theater and Pregones Theater performance of Hugo Bardallo's play Tiene la Muerte Atada (They've Got Death Bound Up), with music by Pablo Zinger; Nelson Landrieu directs; photos (M)","print_page":"5","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Death Gambles and the Neighborhood Loses","kicker":"THEATER REVIEW"},"keywords":[{"name":"creative_works","value":"TIENE LA MUERTE ATADA (PLAY)"},{"name":"persons","value":"ZINGER, PABLO"},{"name":"persons","value":"BARDALLO, HUGO"},{"name":"persons","value":"LANDRIEU, NELSON"},{"name":"organizations","value":"PUERTO RICAN TRAVELING THEATER"},{"name":"organizations","value":"PREGONES THEATER"},{"name":"subject","value":"REVIEWS"},{"name":"subject","value":"THEATER"}],"pub_date":"1999-08-16T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"The Arts\/Cultural Desk","section_name":"Arts; Theater","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[],"original":"By D.

But Patrick Rafter, the two-time defending champion, suffered longest, hardest and last. Worse, he suffered in vain. It was getting on toward midnight at Arthur Ashe Stadium when Rafter, who came into this daunting Slam hobbled by shoulder tendinitis, gave up the ghost in his opener against Cedric Pioline just after surrendering his serve in the first game of the fifth set.","abstract":"Patrick Rafter, defending US Open champion, retires from his first-round match with Cedric Pioline because of sore shoulder; photo (M)","print_page":"1","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"On Day 2, a Bad Case of Tennis Withdrawal","kicker":"U.S. OPEN"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"PIOLINE, CEDRIC"},{"name":"persons","value":"RAFTER, PATRICK"},{"name":"subject","value":"TENNIS"},{"name":"subject","value":"UNITED STATES OPEN (TENNIS)"}],"pub_date":"1999-09-01T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Sports Desk","section_name":"Sports","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Robin","rank":1,"lastname":"FINN"}],"original":"By ROBIN FINN"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd1edfe8eb7c8105d74107e","word_count":1242},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1999\/09\/02\/world\/death-toll-in-argentine-jet-crash-is-put-at-74.html","snippet":"Officials said today that at least 74 people were killed in the crash of a Boeing 737 belonging to the Argentine airline LAPA on Tuesday, and workers continued to pull bodies from the wreckage.

It would have been an unremarkable summer retreat, except that every word spoken was in a language many people imagine to be if not vanished, then just ahead of the California condor on the endangered species list. Yiddish-vokh, or Yiddish week, is an annual retreat organized by Yugntruf (yugntruf@yugntruf.org), a group dedicated to preserving the language. Although many of the campers were over 60, there were also three dozen children and teen-agers, virtually all raised in Yiddish-speaking households. About a dozen of the campers were not Jewish, and the vast majority of Jews were not religious. People traveled from Uruguay, Denmark and England -- and Japan, which has in recent years sent a large contingent. Interest in Yiddish there is mainly due to the country's World War II history.","abstract":"Editorial Notebook by Tina Rosenberg on efforts of Dr Mordkhe Schaechter and others to preserve Yiddish language; notes that while Yiddish language is used daily by 700,000 people worldwide, mostly ultra-Orthodox Hasidim, small group of secular Jews is trying to preserve Yiddish in non-religious world, and to maintain language's literary treasures; describes Yiddish-vokh, or Yiddish week, annual retreat in Berkshires","print_page":"18","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Editorial Notebook; Living an American Life -- in Yiddish"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"SCHAECHTER, MORDKHE"},{"name":"subject","value":"YIDDISH LANGUAGE"}],"pub_date":"1999-09-03T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Editorial Desk","section_name":"Opinion","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Tina","rank":1,"lastname":"ROSENBERG"}],"original":"By TINA ROSENBERG"},"type_of_material":"Editorial","_id":"4fd20fb38eb7c8105d782b97","word_count":726},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1999\/09\/12\/sports\/plus-auto-racing-shell-300-rookie-driver-killed-in-crash.html","snippet":"Gonzalo Rodriguez, a rookie driver, was killed today when his car smashed into a concrete wall at about 160 miles an hour during practice for the Shell 300 at Laguna Seca Raceway in Monterey, Calif.","lead_paragraph":"Gonzalo Rodriguez, a rookie driver, was killed today when his car smashed into a concrete wall at about 160 miles an hour during practice for the Shell 300 at Laguna Seca Raceway in Monterey, Calif.","abstract":"Gonzalo Rodriguez. rookie driver, is killed in practice session for Shell 300 at Laguna Seca Raceway, Monterey, Calif (S)","print_page":"9","blog":[],"source":"AP","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Rookie Driver Killed in Crash","kicker":"PLUS: AUTO RACING -- SHELL 300"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"RODRIGUEZ, GONZALO"},{"name":"subject","value":"SHELL 300 (AUTO RACE)"},{"name":"subject","value":"AUTOMOBILE RACING"}],"pub_date":"1999-09-12T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Sports Desk","section_name":null,"subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd20fb48eb7c8105d782be1","word_count":107},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1999\/09\/13\/sports\/auto-racing-roundup-hakkinen-s-error-is-boon-for-irvine.html","snippet":"On Lap 30 of the 70th Italian Grand Prix at Monza yesterday, Mika Hakkinen threw his racing glove to the ground, stepped into the trees off the side of the track, dropped to his knees and buried his face in his hands.
