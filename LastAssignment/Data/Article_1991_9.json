A few of those attending the Federal Reserve's annual summer conference, including the keynote speaker, went a step further. They argued that the 40-year-old free-trade system, in which more than 90 nations jointly agree to lower tariffs simultaneously, had outlived its usefulness and should give way to these regional trading blocs. The blocs can use tariffs to keep out imports from nations that are not members. Europe, North America Cited These economists said that the European Community and the emerging United States-Mexico-Canada trading zone were already proving more effective than the older free-trade system, known as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, on two important counts. The blocs are generating huge increases in trade among neighboring countries, which are natural trading partners anyway. And, the economists said, regional blocs are becoming a way to exclude Japanese competitors, whose products receive equal treatment in the free-trade system.","abstract":null,"print_page":"1","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Blocs Seen Replacing Free Trade"},"keywords":[{"name":"subject","value":"INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND WORLD MARKET"}],"pub_date":"1991-08-26T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Financial Desk","section_name":"Business","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Louis","rank":1,"lastname":"UCHITELLE"}],"original":"By LOUIS UCHITELLE"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd1a4c58eb7c8105d6bd5fd","word_count":1000},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1991\/08\/30\/business\/economic-scene-urgent-question-on-aid-to-soviets.html","snippet":"AS the Soviet Union struggles on the brink of economic collapse and political dissolution, the urgent question facing the United States and its partners in the Group of Seven industrialized countries is what posture to take on foreign aid to the...","lead_paragraph":"AS the Soviet Union struggles on the brink of economic collapse and political dissolution, the urgent question facing the United States and its partners in the Group of Seven industrialized countries is what posture to take on foreign aid to the nation and its seceding republics. President Bush is still holding to the cautious approach to Soviet aid that Western leaders agreed to during the London economic summit conference in July. In the midst of the incredible events that began 10 days ago with the attempted coup against President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, President Bush said he had \"seen nothing to make me change my mind\" about the group's agreement not to give Moscow direct financial aid until more fundamental steps are taken to establish a market economy.
