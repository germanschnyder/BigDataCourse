Via Brasil restaurant in midtown is getting its party face on, the atmospheric volume pumping up from sedately tropical to riotously soccer. Posters will adorn the walls, trophies will be brought in, goal nets will be strung up like bunting. The World Cup is coming in June. That's when the seven-foot television screen will unfurl from the ceiling, and for a month soccer will be the main item on the menu. Along 46th Street, between Fifth and Sixth avenues, at restaurants such as Via Brasil and Ipanema, at stores such as Coisa Nossa and Emporium Brasil and the Brasil Way Pharmacy, at the BACC Travel Agency, there is feverish anticipation for the calypso beat of Brazilian soccer. Brazil has won the World Cup three times, but not since 1970. This will be the year, that is the word on 46th Street. With the magnificent, creative Romario and Bebeto at forwards, this is Brazil's time.","abstract":null,"print_page":"15","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Soccer's Melting Pot -- A periodic look at the World Cup teams and their fans in the metropolitan area; 1 Team, but 150 Million Coaches"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"BRAZIL"},{"name":"subject","value":"WORLD CUP (SOCCER)"},{"name":"subject","value":"SURVEYS AND SERIES"},{"name":"subject","value":"SOCCER"}],"pub_date":"1994-05-10T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Sports Desk","section_name":"Sports","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Jere","rank":1,"lastname":"LONGMAN"}],"original":"By JERE LONGMAN"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd1da4c8eb7c8105d71a11f","word_count":949},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1994\/05\/12\/business\/world-trade-pact-endorsed.html","snippet":"The White House intensified its campaign for approval the new world trade agreement today, proclaiming the support of consumer advocates despite some deep differences over the treaty.
