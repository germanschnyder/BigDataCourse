Their agenda is much the same as the ill-fated ministerial meeting in Seattle in 1999, when attempts to bridge the gap between poor and wealthy countries' priorities blew up in a cloud of tear gas. The whole world has an interest in seeing this gathering turn out better. With the world's terrorized economy stuck at a standstill, the time is ripe for a cooperative, international push for growth through trade. The ministers' goal in Qatar is to launch a new set of comprehensive trade negotiations. During the original Uruguay Round, which led to the creation of the W.T.O., rich countries pledged to open their markets to textiles, crops and other basic exports from the developing world. There has been some progress in that area, but arcane customs rules, unnecessary red tape, stingy quotas and anti-dumping programs still keep poor nations' exports out of wealthy markets. Now protectionist politicians are trying to erect more barriers by exploiting concerns about border security and food safety.","abstract":"Editorial, commenting on upcoming international trade summit in Qatar; notes agenda is much same as at ill-fated ministerial meeting in Seattle in 1999, but that with world's economy in state of stagnation time is ripe for cooperative, international push for growth through trade; says world has interest in seeing that upcoming gathering turns out better (S)","print_page":"26","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Up From Seattle"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"QATAR"},{"name":"glocations","value":"DOHA (QATAR)"},{"name":"glocations","value":"SEATTLE (WASH)"},{"name":"subject","value":"INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND WORLD MARKET"},{"name":"subject","value":"EDITORIALS"},{"name":"subject","value":"ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND TRENDS"},{"name":"subject","value":"THIRD WORLD AND DEVELOPING COUNTRIES"}],"pub_date":"2001-11-09T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Editorial Desk","section_name":"Opinion","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"Editorial","_id":"4fd218e98eb7c8105d79633e","word_count":474},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2001\/11\/11\/nyregion\/neighborhood-report-midtown-buzz-small-country-big-day-one-ecstatic-moment.html","snippet":"THE SETTING -- More than 100 people are crammed into two rooms at Mammalinda restaurant on West 52nd Street in Manhattan, and they are waiting anxiously for the broadcast of the World Cup qualifying match between Ecuador and Uruguay.
