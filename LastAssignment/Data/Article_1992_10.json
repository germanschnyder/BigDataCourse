An open bar. A buffet with smoked salmon and chefs carving away. But the guest of honor will not be so typical: Thomas Gambino. Yes, the Thomas Gambino who pleaded guilty at his corruption and racketeering trial nine months ago, the Thomas Gambino who prosecutors say is an organized-crime captain and the Thomas Gambino who promised to get out of the short-haul trucking business in the garment industry after paying a $12 million fine.","abstract":null,"print_page":"1","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Thomas Gambino: It's All in the Name"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"REIFF, SIDNEY"},{"name":"persons","value":"GAMBINO, THOMAS"},{"name":"glocations","value":"NEW YORK CITY"},{"name":"glocations","value":"GARMENT DISTRICT (NYC)"},{"name":"organizations","value":"ORT INTERNATIONAL"},{"name":"subject","value":"ORGANIZED CRIME"},{"name":"subject","value":"TRUCKS AND TRUCKING"},{"name":"subject","value":"CRIME AND CRIMINALS"},{"name":"subject","value":"APPAREL"}],"pub_date":"1992-12-02T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Metropolitan Desk","section_name":"New York and Region","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"James","rank":1,"lastname":"BARRON"}],"original":"By JAMES BARRON"},"type_of_material":"Biography","_id":"4fd1c6b58eb7c8105d6f81ab","word_count":911},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1992\/12\/04\/arts\/review-art-founding-inspiration-of-latin-modernism.html","snippet":"Joaquin Torres-Garcia may not have been a great artist, but he was an extremely interesting participant in a great moment in art history.

Born in Uruguay in 1874, he moved to Spain when he was 17 years old and studied painting. His career coincided with the advent of European modernism, and for the next 40 years, in Madrid, Paris and New York, he was a member of a brilliant international group of artists. As a painter he was like a sponge, soaking up the influences of Cubism, Constructivism and finally Neo-Plasticism, whose austere geometries he rendered as tight grids filled with forms that resemble pictographs or children's drawings. His real gifts, though, lay in his role as theoretician and teacher. Erudite, passionate, enthralled with the art of all cultures, especially those of the pre-Columbian Americas, he was dedicated to the concept of an avant-garde in which social, spiritual and formalist ideals meshed.","abstract":null,"print_page":"20","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Review\/Art; Founding Inspiration Of Latin Modernism"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"TORRES-GARCIA, JOAQUIN"},{"name":"organizations","value":"BRONX MUSEUM OF THE ARTS"},{"name":"subject","value":"REVIEWS"},{"name":"subject","value":"ART SHOWS"},{"name":"subject","value":"ART"}],"pub_date":"1992-12-04T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Weekend Desk","section_name":"Arts","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Holland","rank":1,"lastname":"COTTER"}],"original":"By HOLLAND COTTER"},"type_of_material":"Review","_id":"4fd1e3fd8eb7c8105d72e546","word_count":955},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1992\/12\/07\/business\/argentina-signs-debt-accord-with-banks.html","snippet":"In another important step toward resolving the Latin American debt crisis, Argentina and its creditor banks signed a final agreement today that will effectively reduce its commercial bank debt by 35 percent.
