But it's awfully noisy. There's the passing traffic on West 54th Street, beyond the courtyard's wall, along with the Museum Tower's enormous air-conditioning vent, which provides a constant swoosh of white noise. Yet for 11 years this has been the site of choice for Summergarden, the always interesting summertime concert series directed by Joel Sachs. One reason for his success is that, in keeping with the museum's mission and his own interests, Mr. Sachs draws his programs from the 20th century, avoiding quieter works in favor of raucously modern ones that can withstand the required amplification and fit in with the urban ambiance.","abstract":"Anthony Tommasini reviews Juilliard School students, led by Joel Sachs, in Summergarden concert at Museum of Modern Art; photo (M)","print_page":"14","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Fireworks, Of a Sort, At Sculpture Garden","kicker":"MUSIC REVIEW"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"SACHS, JOEL"},{"name":"organizations","value":"MUSEUM OF MODERN ART"},{"name":"organizations","value":"JUILLIARD SCHOOL"},{"name":"subject","value":"SUMMERGARDEN (CONCERT SERIES)"},{"name":"subject","value":"MUSIC"},{"name":"subject","value":"REVIEWS"}],"pub_date":"1997-07-07T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Cultural Desk","section_name":"Arts","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Anthony","rank":1,"lastname":"TOMMASINI"}],"original":"By ANTHONY TOMMASINI"},"type_of_material":"Review","_id":"4fd1fe9a8eb7c8105d75fcb0","word_count":508},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1997\/07\/08\/sports\/soccer-report.html","snippet":"Major League Soccer     The defending champion, D.C.

At least three biographies and several movies about Che will come out this year. The silk-screen Che icon with beard and beret now hawks compact discs, beer, Swatch watches, skis, designer dresses and a host of other products not traditionally associated with international Communism. Scientists have now found his body, one of seven skeletons in a pit in Bolivia, and brought it to Cuba. What would a Che alive today make of all this? He might not approve of the more crass commercialization of his name and image, but if the ideological migrations of his comrades are any indication, he would be firmly in the capitalist camp. Unlike his body, Che's politics remain entombed. Armed, leftist revolution is today found only in Cuba, and in a few violent but tiny bands in Colombia, Peru and now Mexico.","abstract":"Tina Rosenberg Editorial Notebook column contends that politics of late Cuban revolutionary Ernesto (Che) Guevara are long gone in Latin America; maintains that old leftist revolutionaries are now closer to European-style capitalism than anything Che ever preached (M)","print_page":"14","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"The World Resurrects Che","kicker":"Editorial Notebook"},"keywords":[{"name":"creative_works","value":"EDITORIAL NOTEBOOK (TIMES COLUMN)"},{"name":"persons","value":"GUEVARA, ERNESTO"},{"name":"glocations","value":"LATIN AMERICA"},{"name":"glocations","value":"CUBA"},{"name":"subject","value":"EDITORIALS"},{"name":"subject","value":"POLITICS AND GOVERNMENT"},{"name":"subject","value":"ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND TRENDS"}],"pub_date":"1997-07-20T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Editorial Desk","section_name":"Opinion","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Tina","rank":1,"lastname":"ROSENBERG"}],"original":"By TINA ROSENBERG"},"type_of_material":"Editorial","_id":"4fd1fc5c8eb7c8105d75b4df","word_count":657},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1997\/07\/22\/sports\/controversy-on-player-s-salute-to-drug-lords.html","snippet":"The MetroStars are losing in Major League Soccer, but they are creating news around the world.
