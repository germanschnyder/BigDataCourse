The amendment, introduced by Costa Rica at the United Nations Human Rights Commission meeting in Geneva, is intended to strengthen a resolution on Cuba introduced by several Latin American nations. In criticizing the measure, Cuban officials said the United States was forcing ''vile lackeys'' to condemn Havana while ignoring what the officials said were rights abuses against prisoners of war at the United States Naval Station at Guant\u00e1namo Bay.","abstract":"Cuba denounces proposed amendment to United Nations human rights resolution calling for immediate release of more than 75 Cuban dissidents imprisoned in recent weeks; amendment is intended to strengthen resolution on Cuba introduced by several Latin American nations, but human rights advocates say resolution is weak, especially considering that panel began its sessions just as world leaders and rights groups were condemning Cuban government for its recent actions (M)","print_page":"10","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Cuba Attacks U.N.
