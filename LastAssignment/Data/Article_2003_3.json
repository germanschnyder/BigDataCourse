So residents of Mamaroneck have organized the Historic Harbor Street Fair, a festival of free events that will take place downtown today from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. Mamaroneck Avenue will become a pedestrian mall featuring Native American storytelling and dancing; children's games played with sticks, hoops, spoons and eggs and a Civil War-era brass band. There will be a tribute to Norman Rockwell, who lived in Mamaroneck, and a one-room schoolhouse, circa 1816, will provide a glimpse of past school days. Jitterbug dancing to a live swing band will take place in a 1940's canteen, while silent Buster Keaton movies accompanied by the pianist Ben Model will recall Mamaroneck's golden age of filmmaking in the 1920's. The films will be shown free at the Clearview Cinemas' Mamaroneck Playhouse Theater.","abstract":"Footlights column: Historic Harbor Street Fair is slated to open in Mamaroneck, NY; Nowhere to Run, documentary produced by Indian Point Safe Energy Coalition, wins Silver Award in short subject film and video documentary category at 36th annual WorldFest-Houston International Film Festival; fourth graders at King Street School in Port Chester participate in educational program at Neuberger Museum of Art under grant from New York State Council on Arts; soprano Jennifer Marshall of Larchmont wins place in inaugural class of new Renata Scotto Opera Academy at Music Conservatory of Westchester in White Plains; photo (M)","print_page":"8","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"FOOTLIGHTS"},"keywords":[{"name":"creative_works","value":"NOWHERE TO RUN (MOVIE)"},{"name":"persons","value":"MARSHALL, JENNIFER"},{"name":"glocations","value":"MAMARONECK (NY)"},{"name":"organizations","value":"MUSIC CONSERVATORY OF WESTCHESTER"},{"name":"organizations","value":"SCOTTO, RENATA, OPERA ACADEMY"},{"name":"organizations","value":"INDIAN POINT SAFE ENERGY COALITION"},{"name":"organizations","value":"NEUBERGER MUSEUM OF ART"},{"name":"subject","value":"ACCIDENTS AND SAFETY"},{"name":"subject","value":"INDIAN POINT NUCLEAR POWER PLANT (NY)"},{"name":"subject","value":"MOTION PICTURES"},{"name":"subject","value":"CHILDREN AND YOUTH"},{"name":"subject","value":"STREET FAIRS"},{"name":"subject","value":"OPERA"},{"name":"subject","value":"ATOMIC ENERGY"},{"name":"subject","value":"ART"},{"name":"subject","value":"AWARDS, DECORATIONS AND HONORS"}],"pub_date":"2003-06-08T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Westchester Weekly Desk","section_name":"Movies; New York and Region","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Roberta","rank":1,"lastname":"HERSHENSON"}],"original":"By ROBERTA HERSHENSON"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd2432c8eb7c8105d7dc850","word_count":806},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2003\/06\/14\/books\/books-of-the-times-examining-terrorism-s-roots-and-taking-aim-at-its-myths.html","snippet":"NO END TO WAR  Terrorism in the 21st Century  By Walter Laqueur  288 pages.

Not only has he purged the military high command, he has also announced his willingness to allow the extradition of human rights violators wanted in other countries and made it clear that he wants the Supreme Court to declare unconstitutional a series of amnesty laws and pardons that have been in effect for more than a decade.","abstract":"Letter From South America reports that Pres Nestor Kirchner is carrying out inaugural pledge to seek justice for estimated 30,000 people who disappeared during 'dirty war' of military dictatorship between 1976 and 1983; photo of mass grave; Kirchner purges military command, says he will allow extradition of human rights violators wanted in other countries and makes clear he wants Supreme Court to overturn amnesty laws and pardons (M)","print_page":"4","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Now the Dirtiest of Wars Won't Be Forgotten","kicker":"LETTER FROM SOUTH AMERICA"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"KIRCHNER, NESTOR"},{"name":"glocations","value":"ARGENTINA"},{"name":"subject","value":"EXTRADITION"},{"name":"subject","value":"MURDERS AND ATTEMPTED MURDERS"},{"name":"subject","value":"MISSING PERSONS"},{"name":"subject","value":"AMNESTIES AND PARDONS"},{"name":"subject","value":"FREEDOM AND HUMAN RIGHTS"}],"pub_date":"2003-06-18T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Foreign Desk","section_name":"World","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Larry","rank":1,"lastname":"Rohter"}],"original":"By Larry Rohter"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd275728eb7c8105d834d05","word_count":1034},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2003\/06\/18\/dining\/food-stuff-olive-oil-worth-a-trip-to-uruguay.html","snippet":"Olivier Baussan heard that olive trees had been planted in central Uruguay about 50 years ago by French immigrants.
