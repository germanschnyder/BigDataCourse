The main effect of the proposal would be to strengthen a requirement that European television stations must dedicate at least 51 percent of broadcast time to European programming. Many stations have avoided meeting the quota by relying on a modifying phrase -- \"where practicable\" -- in the requirement.","abstract":null,"print_page":"8","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"New Curbs Proposed on Foreign TV Programs in Europe","kicker":"THE MEDIA BUSINESS"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"EUROPE"},{"name":"glocations","value":"GREAT BRITAIN"},{"name":"organizations","value":"EUROPEAN UNION"},{"name":"subject","value":"TELEVISION"}],"pub_date":"1995-03-23T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Business\/Financial Desk","section_name":"Business","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Alan","rank":1,"lastname":"RIDING"}],"original":"By ALAN RIDING"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd1c66b8eb7c8105d6f7397","word_count":797},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1995\/03\/24\/opinion\/fencing-off-the-women-s-conference.html","snippet":"The United Nations Secretariat is tarnishing a forthcoming conference on women's issues by denying credentials to a slew of non-governmental organizations, possibly more than 200, without explaining why.

The action has bred suspicion that the Secretariat is responding to political pressures from the conference's Chinese hosts or such powerful participants as the Vatican. In several instances, the denials resulted from direct pressure. The Chinese, who were eager to have Beijing as the conference site, pledged that the forum would be open to all relevant non-governmental as well as governmental groups. However, they asked, and got, the U.N. to deny credentials to women's organizations from Taiwan and Tibet, their political adversaries. The Vatican does not want to hear from Catholics critical of the church's views on family life and abortion. It tried to have the U.N. deny credentials to Catholics for a Free Choice and its sister groups in Mexico, Brazil and Uruguay, but were repulsed after an outcry.","abstract":null,"print_page":"30","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Fencing Off the Women's Conference"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"CHINA"},{"name":"organizations","value":"ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH"},{"name":"organizations","value":"UNITED NATIONS"},{"name":"subject","value":"EDITORIALS"},{"name":"subject","value":"CONVENTIONS AND CONFERENCES"},{"name":"subject","value":"WOMEN"}],"pub_date":"1995-03-24T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Editorial Desk","section_name":"Opinion","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"Editorial","_id":"4fd1cb7f8eb7c8105d701088","word_count":244},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1995\/03\/28\/sports\/soccer-report.html","snippet":"European Championship    Nineteen games will be staged throughout Europe tomorrow in attempts to qualify for the European Championship in England next year.
