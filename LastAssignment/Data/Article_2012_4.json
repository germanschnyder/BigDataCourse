And though many pressing questions about a new acquaintance can be easily answered (or so it seems) with a few taps on a smartphone, Savannah Auger and James Citron remained blissfully unaware of entire sections of each other's lives when they began dating. She thought he was an airline pilot, and she did not tell him that she had a flourishing second career as a singer -- and would be on the road for weeks at a time. Mr. Citron, now 34, said that when he first spotted Ms. Auger, across a crowded party, he gaped. The party had been given by their yoga teacher at a bar in the Venice neighborhood of Los Angeles where Mr. Citron lived. Ms. Auger was one of some 30 women there, but Mr. Citron (one of the very few men in attendance) zeroed in on her.","abstract":null,"print_page":"13","blog":[],"source":"The New York
