The two teams will play next Monday afternoon -- the Fourth of July -- in Palo Alto, Calif. The Americans' advancement came on a day they were idle. But it was an otherwise busy afternoon in soccer's biggest event as teams vied for berths in the second round. Mexico won the glamour group, the so-called \"Group of Death\" ahead of Ireland and Italy, and a Russian player, Oleg Salenko, set a World Cup single-game record with five goals during a 6-1 rout that eliminated Cameroon.
