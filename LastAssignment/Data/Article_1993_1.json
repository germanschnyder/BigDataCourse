Seles is on track to overtake Chris Evert as the career leader in winnning percentage and could do it in this tournament. Evert retired having won 89.96 percent of her matches, with a record of 1,309-146. Although nowhere near the number of Evert's victories, Seles needs to win this tournament, which would mean winning four more matches, to bring her record to 252-28, which would be exactly 90 percent. Seles's next opponent will be an Austrian, Judith Wiesner, who defeated a qualifier, Kirsten Freye of Germany, 2-6, 6-4, 6-0. The only other seeded player who competed yesterday, No. 3 Conchita Martinez of Spain, sailed into the second round with a 6-2, 6-1 victory over Petra Thoren of Finland.
