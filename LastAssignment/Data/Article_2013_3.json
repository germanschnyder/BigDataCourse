He had just celebrated his 97th birthday with his family. He was born, reared and educated in Washington, DC. During WW II he was stationed at the United States embassies in Santiago, Chile, and in Montevideo, Uruguay, where he became fluent in Spanish. In 1946 he joined Coca-Cola Export Corporation and was assigned to Germany as a Technical Observer. The following year he was transferred to Buenos Aires, Argentina, subsequently serving in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, where he learned Portuguese, and then Lima, Peru, as manager of the Andean Region. In 1962 Don was elected a Vice President of The Coca-Cola Export Corporation. In 1967 he was appointed manager of the Western European Area and lived in Brussels, Belgium, then in Paris, France. He retired in 1976 to finally live in his favorite city, New York. Paris was his second favorite city where he owned an apartment on Avenue George V with a fabulous view of the Tour Eiffel. Soon after World War II, in July 1946, his only brother, Vincent Ambrose Sisler, who served as a submarine commander in the Pacific, was killed in an automobile accident, leaving three small daughters. Don was a loving, caring uncle to his nieces and their families throughout his life. He took great pleasure in showing his family, friends and visitors from abroad the wonders of New York City. He was a great supporter of the performing arts, especially the Metropolitan Opera, where he was an Advisory Director, and underwrote ten of its PBS telecasts. Putting on his tux and striding across Central Park from his home on 5th Ave to the Met was a great joy for him. He was a wonderful raconteur, with a terrific sense of humor and an infectious laugh. His joie de vivre set an example for his family and friends. Charming, kind and caring to everyone, he was a gentleman of the old school an extraordinary man who lived an extraordinary life. He is survived by his nieces, Anne Sisler Latta and Tonia Sisler, nephew Dr. Adrian Sherman, great-nephews Jeffrey Latta and Michael Jacobs, great-niece Katherine Jacobs, and great-great nephew, Holden Latta.","abstract":null,"print_page":"20","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Paid Notice: Deaths  SISLER, DONALD GRANT"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"SISLER, DONALD GRANT"}],"pub_date":"2013-03-31T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Classified","section_name":"Paid Death Notices","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"Paid Death Notice","_id":"5160f0c8cf28d0219d005fb3","word_count":"366"}]},"status":"OK","copyright":"Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
