There are a rising number of key players in the trading system, the United States Congress remains at odds with the President over protectionism and the easiest measures to foster more-balanced trade are already in place. The biggest stumbling block to continued progress, however, was removed here Saturday, when ministers from the signatory countries of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade set an agenda for the Uruguay round of trade talks, the eighth round since the agreement came into effect after World War II. The agreement on the agenda was reached after a weeklong meeting in a vacated hotel casino on a peninsula jutting into the wintry South Atlantic. In place of roulette wheels and slot machines were long rows of felt-covered tables where delegates from 74 nations argued over rules that should govern world trade into the 21st century.","abstract":null,"print_page":"7","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"GATT TALKS FACING TOUGH OBSTACLES"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"PUNTA DEL ESTE (URUGUAY)"},{"name":"organizations","value":"GENERAL AGREEMENT ON TARIFFS AND TRADE"},{"name":"subject","value":"INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND WORLD MARKET"}],"pub_date":"1986-09-22T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Financial Desk","section_name":"Business","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"firstname":"Clyde","middlename":"H.","lastname":"FARNSWORTH","rank":1,"role":"reported","organization":""},{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":2}],"original":"By CLYDE H.

It is just such devotion that gave birth to the United Nations: devotion to the dream of world peace and freedom, of human rights and democratic self-determination, of a time when, in those ancient words: ''And they shall beat their swords into plowshares. Nations shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war anymore.'' The United States remains committed to the U.N.

Until now, trade has been conducted largely through the Ministry of Foreign Trade and affiliated foreign organizations rather than with manufacturers or end users. That unwieldy process consumed considerable time and offered little incentive for Soviet enterprises to sell or buy abroad. Under the new measures, outlined in Tuesday's issue of the newspaper Sotsialisticheskaya Industriya, or Socialist Industry, more than 20 ministries and 70 major enterprises will have the right to operate directly with Western and developing countries and to maintain their own accounts in convertible currencies.

The plan calls for $20 billion annually in capital commitments from the United States and other industrial nations over the next several years. The amount is far more than that proposed by Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d at the joint annual meeting of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund in Seoul, South Korea, last October. Mr. Baker called for new investments of $29 billion over three years to spur growth in 15 major debtor nations, 10 of them in Latin America. The economists began formulating their plan before Mr. Baker's announcement, and many of their recommendations overlap with his. But the economists say they doubt that commercial banks are ready to answer Mr. Baker's call to provide about $20 billion of the increased financing and so have proposed a far larger role for multinational institutions such as the World Bank in the early years of their plan. Under the Baker plan, such institutions would increase loans by $9 billion over three years.","abstract":null,"print_page":"18","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"NEW STUDY OFFERS PLAN TO RESCUE LATIN ECONOMIES"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"BAKER, JAMES A 3D"},{"name":"glocations","value":"LATIN AMERICA"},{"name":"organizations","value":"INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND"},{"name":"organizations","value":"INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT"},{"name":"subject","value":"UNITED STATES INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS"},{"name":"subject","value":"ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND TRENDS"},{"name":"subject","value":"FOREIGN AID"}],"pub_date":"1986-09-28T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Foreign Desk","section_name":"World; Washington","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"firstname":"Barnaby","middlename":"J.","lastname":"FEDER","rank":1,"role":"reported","organization":""}],"original":"By BARNABY J.

By William McCord with Arline McCord. 352 pp. New York: W. W. Norton & Company. $17.95.

''If the largest debtor normalizes the situation, the crisis becomes much smaller,'' said the 52-year-old former business executive, who is the chief architect of the so-called Cruzado Plan.
