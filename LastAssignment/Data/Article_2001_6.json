Presumably, that includes art, not too hard to find in a megalopolis known for its formidable museums. From the quiet college town of nearby Wellesley to the swarming student-faculty hive of Cambridge to the deep-city precincts of the Fenway and Boylston Street, there are exhibitions for the taste of any viewer, traveling on foot, by cab or by Boston transit. Here are a few shows you might see on a summer's day. When we think of art south of the border, it is usually the representational works of Diego Rivera, Frida Kahlo, Jos\u00e9 Clemente Orozco and company. Latin American art hasn't seemed to dwell much on the rigors of abstraction, particularly nonobjective abstraction, the absence of reference to the outside world. For most museumgoers, that is a European concept, expressed by Piet Mondrian and the de Stijl movement in Europe and promoted in the United States by the Mondrian-influenced American Abstract artists, beginning in the 1930's.","abstract":"Grace Glueck reviews art exhibits in and around Boston this summer: Latin American geometric abstracts at Fogg Art Museum at Harvard, The Social Scene and Nikki S Lee photos at Institute of Contemporary Art, Madonna images at Davis Museum at Wellesley College and Laura Owens oils, watercolors and collages at Gardner Museum; photos; map (M)","print_page":"27","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"A Universe Of Art, Centered In Boston","kicker":"ART REVIEW"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"LEE, NIKKI S"},{"name":"persons","value":"OWENS, LAURA"},{"name":"glocations","value":"BOSTON (MASS)"},{"name":"organizations","value":"HARVARD UNIVERSITY"},{"name":"organizations","value":"DAVIS MUSEUM AND CULTURAL CENTER"},{"name":"organizations","value":"INSTITUTE OF CONTEMPORARY ART"},{"name":"organizations","value":"GARDNER, ISABELLA STEWART, MUSEUM"},{"name":"organizations","value":"FOGG ART MUSEUM"},{"name":"subject","value":"REVIEWS"},{"name":"subject","value":"ART"},{"name":"subject","value":"TRAVEL AND VACATIONS"}],"pub_date":"2001-08-17T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Leisure\/Weekend Desk","section_name":"Travel; Arts","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Grace","rank":1,"lastname":"GLUECK"}],"original":"By GRACE GLUECK"},"type_of_material":"Review","_id":"4fd20ac38eb7c8105d777c53","word_count":2143},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2001\/08\/18\/world\/balloonist-calls-off-his-global-conquest-and-lands-in-brazil.html","snippet":"An American millionaire's fifth attempt to become the first person to complete an around-the-world solo balloon trip came to an abrupt end early today when a prediction of bad weather forced him to land in a cow pasture near Brazil's southern border....","lead_paragraph":"An American millionaire's fifth attempt to become the first person to complete an around-the-world solo balloon trip came to an abrupt end early today when a prediction of bad weather forced him to land in a cow pasture near Brazil's southern border.

O'Neill lamented in negotiating sessions over the past week that nobody seemed to be thinking creatively about ways of alleviating the country's debt problems without more loans.

(212-423-3500) www.guggenheim.org June * ''MICHIEL SWEERTS'' A Flemish contemporary of Rembrandt, Sweerts painted genre scenes and portraits with a similarly shadowy palette but gave the work an aura of sad, delicate reticence.
