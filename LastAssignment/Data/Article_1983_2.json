It was a scandal of international proportions.

Few Uruguayans make the trip, although Punta del Este, situated at the broad mouth of the Rio de la Plata, about 200 miles east of Buenos Aires, is their nation's most developed resort. Many Uruguayans say they prefer to avoid the Argentines, who are noticeable by their harsh Spanish and skimpy bathing suits. Local officials estimate that Argentines make up more than 85 percent of the summer population, which normally peaks at more than 100,000. Ninety percent of the land is said to be owned by Argentines.","abstract":null,"print_page":"14","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"URUGUAY RESORT FEELS COLD WIND FROM ARGENTINA"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"ARGENTINA"},{"name":"glocations","value":"URUGUAY"},{"name":"subject","value":"PUNTA DEL ESTE (URAGUAY)"},{"name":"subject","value":"INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS"},{"name":"subject","value":"GEOGRAPHIC PROFILES"}],"pub_date":"1983-03-10T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Foreign Desk","section_name":"World","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Edward","rank":1,"lastname":"SCHUMACHER"},{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":2}],"original":"By EDWARD SCHUMACHER, Special to the New York Times"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd12dc48eb7c8105d5f8a0c","word_count":646},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1983\/03\/13\/magazine\/revloution-and-the-intellectual-in-latin-america.html","snippet":"On his way from Mexico City to Stockholm to receive the 1982 Nobel Prize in Literature, and again on the way back, Gabriel Garcia Marquez stopped over in Cuba to see his close friend and political mentor, Fidel Castro.

The Colombian novelist is a frequent traveler to Havana, but these two visits took on special significance: He was emphasizing his political identification with Cuba at the moment of his greatest literary glory. In contrast, Octavio Paz, the Mexican poet and essayist, has not visited Havana since the 1959 Cuban revolution. He once sympathized with the announced objectives of the new regime, but became disenchanted when, in his words, the revolution was ''confiscated'' by Marxists. He now considers the Cuban people no more fortunate than they were before the overthrow of the rightist dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista. Garcia Marquez and Paz live seven miles apart in Mexico City and are great admirers of each other's writing, but they are no longer close friends. Politics, their common obsession, has divided them. They have become symbols of the two opposing views in the rising political debate among Latin America's intellectuals.","abstract":null,"print_page":"28","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"REVLOUTION AND THE INTELLECTUAL IN LATIN AMERICA"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"LATIN AMERICA"},{"name":"subject","value":"WAR AND REVOLUTION"},{"name":"subject","value":"WRITING AND WRITERS"},{"name":"subject","value":"BOOKS AND LITERATURE"},{"name":"subject","value":"POLITICS AND GOVERNMENT"}],"pub_date":"1983-03-13T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Magazine Desk","section_name":"Magazine; Books","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Alan","rank":1,"lastname":"Riding"}],"original":"By Alan Riding; Alan Riding is chief of The New York Times's bureau in Mexico City"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd133a78eb7c8105d6033dd","word_count":5930},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1983\/03\/13\/business\/the-maze-of-latin-america-s-debt.html","snippet":"FROM a statistical perspective, it seems safe to assert that withoutL atin America, the international debt crisis would not exist.

By the end of 1982, eight Latin American countries had gross e xternal debts of nearly $300 billion -about 55 percent of the $550 b illion that 50 developing nations owed to foreign creditors at y ear's end, according to figures from the Morgan Guaranty Trust C ompany. By themselves, Argentina, Brazil and Mexico accounted for $ 202.5 billion. Fresh commercial loans and billion-dollar aid packages and reschedulings from the International Monetary Fund and other multilateral institutions have eased the international crisis for the time being. But the Latin American debt problem is far from solved. ''This is a situation requiring almost continuous nervous attention on the part of everyone involved,'' said Robert V. Roosa, a partner at Brown Brothers Harriman & Company. ''Enough has been done in the last eight or nine months to put the framework in place for handling their excessive debt burden, but there is no room for euphoria.''","abstract":null,"print_page":"4","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"THE MAZE OF LATIN AMERICA'S DEBT"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"LATIN AMERICA"},{"name":"subject","value":"FINANCES"},{"name":"subject","value":"CREDIT"},{"name":"subject","value":"THIRD WORLD AND DEVELOPING COUNTRIES"}],"pub_date":"1983-03-13T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Financial Desk","section_name":"Business","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"firstname":"Kenneth","middlename":"N.","lastname":"GILPIN","rank":1,"role":"reported","organization":""}],"original":"By KENNETH N.
