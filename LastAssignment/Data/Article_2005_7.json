For most caviar lovers, there are plenty of other options. And more than ever, they are farm-raised. When embargoes on importing beluga took effect in September and October, most dealers said that they already had enough beluga to last through the end of the year. Beluga is the largest of three types of sturgeon legally harvested for caviar in the Caspian Sea. The other two are osetra and sevruga, both of them also the name not only of the fish but also of the caviar. There are also beluga sturgeon in the Black Sea.","abstract":null,"print_page":"1","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Lovers of Caviar, Look to the Farm"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"2005-12-14T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Dining, Dining Out\/Cultural Desk","section_name":"Arts; Dining and Wine","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Florence","lastname":"FABRICANT"}],"original":"By FLORENCE FABRICANT"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd24e738eb7c8105d7efffb","word_count":1319},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2005\/12\/18\/weekinreview\/18forero.html","snippet":"The appeal of rural socialism is a powerful reminder that much of South America has become disenchanted with the promises of global capitalism.","lead_paragraph":"AT first glance, there's nothing cutting edge about this isolated highland town of mud-brick homes and cold mountain streams. The way of life is remarkably unchanged from what it was centuries ago. The Aymara Indian villagers have no hot water or telephones, and each day they slog into the fields to shear wool and grow potatoes. But Tacamara and dozens of similar communities across the scrub grass of the Bolivian highlands are at the forefront of a new leftward tide now rising in Latin American politics. Tired of poverty and indifferent governments, villagers here are being urged by some of their more radical leaders to forget the promises of capitalism and install instead a community-based socialism in which products would be bartered. Some leaders even talk of forming an independent Indian state.","abstract":null,"print_page":"4","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"width":600,"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/packages\/khtml\/2005\/12\/18\/weekinreview\/200511218_FORERO_FEATURE.html","pay":"n","rank":"1","height":475,"credit":"With poverty up, old promises from capitalists don't look so good.
