Beijing is buying them by the dozens to build the giant Three Gorges Dam, which the Administration considers damaging to the environment. So the Chinese have turned to suppliers in Japan and Europe, where governments are less concerned about the environment and more forthcoming with credit. ''We've only managed to sell the Chinese a few off-highway trucks,'' a Caterpillar official said.","abstract":"Process of economic globalization is still in early stage as nationality still binds most multinational companies to home; proliferation of treaty negotiations in recent months, aimed at setting rules for global economy--most of them favorable so far to business--has raised new new questions: just how untethered are these companies and who, therefore, should have voice in rule-making? 12 different rule-making negotiations are currently under way; most are inspired by North American Free Trade Agreement and treaty that set up World Trade Organization, in which US and 116 other nations agreed essentially to recognize WTO ruling as having power of national law; for all their involvement in overseas sales and investment, multinational companies like Caterpillar Inc in America, Mitsubishi Corp in Japan or Volkswagen in Germany are still tied to regulations and laws of their countries; graph; drawing (L)","print_page":"1","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS -- Global Tug, National Tether; As Companies Look Overseas, Governments Hold the Strings"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"JAPAN"},{"name":"glocations","value":"GERMANY"},{"name":"organizations","value":"MITSUBISHI CORP"},{"name":"organizations","value":"CATERPILLAR INC"},{"name":"organizations","value":"WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION"},{"name":"organizations","value":"VOLKSWAGEN AG"},{"name":"subject","value":"NORTH AMERICAN FREE TRADE AGREEMENT"},{"name":"subject","value":"INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND WORLD MARKET"},{"name":"subject","value":"MULTINATIONAL COMPANIES"},{"name":"subject","value":"TREATIES"},{"name":"subject","value":"LAW AND LEGISLATION"},{"name":"subject","value":"ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND TRENDS"},{"name":"subject","value":"REGULATION AND DEREGULATION OF INDUSTRY"}],"pub_date":"1998-04-30T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Business\/Financial Desk","section_name":"Business","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Louis","rank":1,"lastname":"UCHITELLE"}],"original":"By LOUIS UCHITELLE"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd2053e8eb7c8105d76d803","word_count":1796},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1998\/05\/03\/nyregion\/good-eating-queens-welcomes-big-eaters.html","snippet":"ELIAS CORNER +  (718) 932-1510; 24-02 31st Street, at 24th Avenue, Astoria; $; no smoking; no credit cards.","lead_paragraph":"ELIAS CORNER + (718) 932-1510; 24-02 31st Street, at 24th Avenue, Astoria; $; no smoking; no credit cards.","abstract":"Good Eating column provides brief summaries of previous reviews of Queens, New York City, restaurants (M)","print_page":"32","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Queens Welcomes Big Eaters","kicker":"GOOD EATING"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"QUEENS (NYC)"},{"name":"glocations","value":"NEW YORK CITY"},{"name":"subject","value":"REVIEWS"},{"name":"subject","value":"RESTAURANTS"}],"pub_date":"1998-05-03T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"The City Weekly Desk","section_name":"New York and Region","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"Review","_id":"4fd218758eb7c8105d7953a1","word_count":1238},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1998\/05\/03\/nyregion\/missing-one-banker-66-million-trail-grows-cold-fbi-hunts-for-loan-officer-with.html","snippet":"The $66 million man began his strategic descent into invisibility in late February, and by now it seems complete.
