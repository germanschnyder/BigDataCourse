Granted, hostelers must be willing to sleep in bunk beds, share bedrooms and bathrooms with as many as seven others and sometimes perform housekeeping chores, including sweeping floors. But at an average cost of $3 to $5 per night, the budget-minded nowadays may be willing to overlook inconvenience and even adhere to occasional prohibitions against liquor, cigarettes, mixing of the sexes and staying out after midnight. The trouble with hostels in the United States, say enthusiasts fresh from their European adventures, is that they are too few and far between. West Germany, for example, boasts more than 550 facilities and children are introduced to hostels as part of their schooling. In London, four facilities provide 1,000 beds on any night, while many of the 269 hostels dotting the English and Welsh countrysides are only a day's hike or bike trip from each other.","abstract":null,"print_page":"22","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"CONGRESS MAY HELP MODESTLY HELP MODEST TRAEL"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"1980-07-13T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Week in Review Desk","section_name":"Week in Review","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Jill","lastname":"SMOLOWE"}],"original":"By JILL SMOLOWE"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd114998eb7c8105d5ca282","word_count":1002},{"web_url":"http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/abstract.html?res=9F05E7DF1038E432A25750C1A9619C94619FD6CF","snippet":"Long associated with backpacking youngsters hitchhiking across Europe, hostels may soon be gaining popular support, and Government aid, in the United States.

They have suffered historic defeats at the hands of Chile and Paraguay, shrinking the nation's borders and cutting off its outlet to the Pacific. But Bolivia's generals and lakebound admirals have found their true calling at home, in the repeated overthrow of Bolivian governments. In 150 years they have perpetrated many of the nearly 200 changes of government. In recent years they have seemed intent on quickening even that astonishing pace. Their coup last week was the fourth, and most brutal, in two years. The military remains blatantly opposed to the democratic process. The coup-makers last week said they acted ''for the dignity of Bolivia, to reject the results of the general elections and to declare the Congress and its actions unconstitutional.'' Those elections were leading to the imminent installation of former President Hernan Siles Suazo for a new term at the head of a leftist coalition. Whatever one thinks of his political bedfellows, Mr. Siles's repeated election successes gave him legitimacy. That cannot be said for the new junta. Many Bolivians, including those in the powerful tin miners' union, have refused to resign themselves to democracy's defeat and have taken up arms against the military.","abstract":null,"print_page":"20","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"For the Dignity of Bolivia"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"1980-07-23T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Editorial Desk","section_name":"Opinion","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd1149f8eb7c8105d5ca54d","word_count":367},{"web_url":"http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/abstract.html?res=950DE6D61230E532A25750C2A9619C94619FD6CF","snippet":"Bolivia's armed forces don't brag about their record against foreign enemies.
