A possible flaw in a suddenly breathless duel between two of the three highest-ranked teams in the world helped end the Dutch hopes and sent Brazil to a semifinal game for the first time since 1970. Once more, in a tournament that has already seen several instances of supported criticism of its officiating, a decision helped decide the outcome of a game. One possible missed offside call against Brazil, just before Bebeto's goal gave his team a 2-0 lead on the way to a 3-2 victory, raised a question after the game.","abstract":null,"print_page":"3","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"A Call the Dutch Won't Soon Forget","kicker":"WORLD CUP '94"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"NETHERLANDS"},{"name":"glocations","value":"BRAZIL"},{"name":"subject","value":"OFFICIATING (SPORTS)"},{"name":"subject","value":"WORLD CUP (SOCCER)"},{"name":"subject","value":"SOCCER"}],"pub_date":"1994-07-10T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Sports Desk","section_name":"Sports","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Malcolm","rank":1,"lastname":"MORAN"}],"original":"By MALCOLM MORAN"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd1dc558eb7c8105d71d6c0","word_count":593},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1994\/07\/14\/sports\/world-cup-94-brazil-s-star-soars-to-new-heights-as-goal-scorer.html","snippet":"The Brazilians were holding hands in a show of unity as they came onto the carpet of the Rose Bowl and they left embracing each other in celebration.

But he tarnished that reputation last week by pushing a number of trade-closing amendments through his committee. The committee was voting on the Administration's proposed legislation to institute the Uruguay Round trade pact, which the U.S. signed with over 100 other nations in April in Marrakech, Morocco. The Senate Finance Committee takes up the legislation today. The most controversial issue concerns \"anti-dumping\" statutes, which govern how the U.S. will retaliate against countries that export goods at unfairly low prices -- for example, prices below the exporter's manufacturing cost.","abstract":null,"print_page":"20","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Retreating on the Trade Pact"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"GIBBONS, SAM"},{"name":"glocations","value":"UNITED STATES"},{"name":"subject","value":"INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND WORLD MARKET"},{"name":"subject","value":"EDITORIALS"},{"name":"subject","value":"PROTECTIONISM (TRADE)"},{"name":"subject","value":"URUGUAY ROUND (TRADE TALKS)"},{"name":"subject","value":"DUMPING (TRADE TERM)"},{"name":"subject","value":"LAW AND LEGISLATION"}],"pub_date":"1994-07-27T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Editorial Desk","section_name":"Opinion","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"Editorial","_id":"4fd1c0cb8eb7c8105d6ef576","word_count":388},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1994\/07\/30\/business\/investing-bright-skies-in-mexico-bode-well-for-adr-s.html","snippet":"IT'S getting sunny in Mexico again, and one way investors can bask in the warmth without heading south is through American depository receipts.
