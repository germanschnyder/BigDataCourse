Suffused in celestial light, a vigorous New Order serenely takes over from the diminished indigenes. But the changeover was even bigger in scale than Brownscombe knew. In ''The First Thanksgiving,'' as in other depictions of the first Thanksgiving meal, natives and newcomers share their feast on a field of bluegrass, dandelion and clover -- three species that did not exist in the Americas before colonization.","abstract":"Charles C Mann Thanksgiving Day Op-Ed article contends that ecosystems that evolved separately for millennia collided when Pilgrims arrived in Plymouth, Mass, in 1620; holds that ever since Plymouth, Americans have lived in new and distinctly contemporary kind of environment, one marked by continued, rapid ecological change; says what was being created on first Thanksgiving was nothing less than American landscape itself; drawing; photo (M)","print_page":"35","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Unnatural Abundance","kicker":"Op-Ed Contributor"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"PLYMOUTH (MASS)"},{"name":"subject","value":"AGRICULTURE"},{"name":"subject","value":"ARCHAEOLOGY AND ANTHROPOLOGY"},{"name":"subject","value":"THANKSGIVING DAY"},{"name":"subject","value":"INDIANS, AMERICAN"},{"name":"subject","value":"POPULATION"},{"name":"subject","value":"ENVIRONMENT"},{"name":"subject","value":"HISTORY"},{"name":"subject","value":"FOOD"}],"pub_date":"2004-11-25T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Editorial Desk","section_name":"Opinion","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"firstname":"Charles","middlename":"C.","lastname":"Mann","rank":1,"role":"reported","organization":""}],"original":"By Charles C.

''Death to the fascist insect that preys upon the life of the people!'' is one of their favorite mottos. No, these terrorists aren't members of Al Qaeda. They were a mixed-race group of radical leftists fighting against the Vietnam War, racism and other social ills in the 1970's. Based in the San Francisco area and calling themselves the Symbionese Liberation Army, they kidnapped the 19-year-old newspaper heiress Patricia Hearst on Feb. 4, 1974. They demanded a $300 million ransom in the form of food for the poor and needy. The Hearst family acquiesced.
