''Without a doubt this helps clean up some decisions I have to make, and we're getting closer,'' Arena, the U.S. coach, said after the Americans' 1-0 victory over Mexico on Wednesday night in Denver. ''I think after the game in Ireland, we'll be able to make some firm decisions.'' The United States has four more exhibitions before the World Cup begins in June: April 17 at Ireland; May 12 against Uruguay at Washington; May 16 against Jamaica at Giants Stadium; and May 19 against the Netherlands at Foxboro, Mass. The victory over Mexico before a crowd of 48,476 was the United States' eighth in 10 games this year and its seventh straight shutout at home. The Americans, who have won four of their last five games against Mexico, were unorganized offensively in the first half and managed just one shot. In the second half, they worked the ball around better and had several good scoring chances before Clint Mathis scored in the 66th minute, after goalie Oscar Perez and defender Manuel Vidrio collided. It was Mathis's eighth international goal and his seventh straight game with a point. BORUSSIA AND FEYENOORD WIN: Borussia Dortmund beat AC Milan by 4-0 and Feyenoord Rotterdam topped Internazionale of Milan by 1-0 in the UEFA Cup semifinals, making an all-Milan final on May 8 very unlikely. The Italian clubs are trying to become the tournament's first two finalists from the same city. In Milan, the Colombian defender Ivan Ramiro Cordoba deflected a low cross by striker Pierre van Hooijdonk into his own net, allowing Feyenoord to move closer to its first European title since winning the 1974 UEFA Cup. The game marked the return of Internazionale's Brazilian striker Ronaldo after a 102-day injury layoff. In Dortmund, Germany, Marcio Amoroso scored three goals for Borussia.","abstract":"US defeats Mexico, 1-0, in World Cup exhibiton match, giving coach Bruce Arena clear idea of who will make US roster (M)","print_page":"7","blog":[],"source":"AP","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Victory Helps Arena With His Decisions","kicker":"PLUS: SOCCER"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"ARENA, BRUCE"},{"name":"glocations","value":"MEXICO"},{"name":"subject","value":"WORLD CUP (SOCCER)"},{"name":"subject","value":"SOCCER"},{"name":"subject","value":"COACHES AND MANAGERS"}],"pub_date":"2002-04-05T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Sports Desk","section_name":null,"subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd273318eb7c8105d8308de","word_count":312},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2002\/04\/14\/nyregion\/new-jersey-makes-the-world-takes.html","snippet":"FROM the docks in Elizabeth and Camden, from cargo flights out of Newark International Airport and on rails extending to Canada and Mexico, New Jersey is extending its reach far into the global economy.

Worldwide, there are 150 regional free-trade and customs agreements; the United States is a party to only three. Each one sets new rules and opens markets for those that have signed on and creates hurdles for those outside the agreement. Trade legislation that could help remedy this imbalance is awaiting Senate consideration. Prompt action is needed to clear the way for America's international trade leadership and economic interests. Last Dec. 6 the House of Representatives passed a trade promotion authority bill that would allow the president to negotiate trade agreements that Congress would then consider through an up-or-down vote. Within a week of House action, the Senate Finance Committee passed a similar bill by a vote of 18 to 3, demonstrating strong bipartisan support. On Jan. 4, in a speech on America's new economic challenges, Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle emphasized his support for this trade bill and his intent ''to bring it up for a vote in the full Senate early this year.''
