Mr. d'Aubuisson was 48 years old. He had been suffering from throat cancer since April 1991 and had made several trips to the United States for medical treatment. During the years of civil war, many wealthy landowners viewed Mr. d'Aubuisson as a relentless crusader against what they saw as threats to their existence from those demanding land redistribution and political reforms.","abstract":null,"print_page":"19","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Roberto d'Aubuisson, 48, Far-Rightist in Salvador"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"D'AUBUISSON, ROBERTO"},{"name":"glocations","value":"EL SALVADOR"},{"name":"subject","value":"DEATHS"}],"pub_date":"1992-02-21T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Foreign Desk","section_name":"World; Obituaries","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Richard","rank":1,"lastname":"SEVERO"}],"original":"By RICHARD SEVERO"},"type_of_material":"Biography; Obituary","_id":"4fd1cdd08eb7c8105d705684","word_count":1179},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1992\/02\/21\/business\/economic-scene-australia-s-angst-on-us-behavior.html","snippet":"AUSTRALIANS consider themselves among the staunchest friends and allies of the United States, having fought beside Americans in World War I, World War II, Korea, Vietnam and the Persian Gulf.

But during a swing from Melbourne to Sydney to Brisbane and Cairns, this reporter found Australians giving vent to their worries and frustrations about America's political and economic behavior. Australians' anxieties about the United States are intensified by Australia's own recession -- the deepest in 60 years. Unemployment rose to a postwar rate of more than 10 percent in recent months. Business investment has fallen sharply, as the roaring boom of the 80's went bust.","abstract":null,"print_page":"2","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Economic Scene; Australia's Angst On U.S. Behavior"},"keywords":[{"name":"creative_works","value":"ECONOMIC SCENE (TIMES COLUMN)"},{"name":"glocations","value":"AUSTRALIA"},{"name":"glocations","value":"UNITED STATES"},{"name":"subject","value":"INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND WORLD MARKET"}],"pub_date":"1992-02-21T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Financial Desk","section_name":"Business","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Leonard","rank":1,"lastname":"Silk"}],"original":"By Leonard Silk"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd1cdd08eb7c8105d70568d","word_count":766},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1992\/02\/23\/magazine\/behind-the-new-faces.html","snippet":"THE FASHION WORLD is currently fixated on a few reigning beauties so ubiquitous they're known simply by their first names.

But there is a new generation of gorgeous young women right behind them. And since fashion, like a vampire, feasts on fresh blood, they're starting to attract attention. For the most part, the new beauties are still known by their pictures, not their names. There's the blonde in the latest Guess ad, the one pretending she's Marilyn Monroe. And the lace-clad knockout in a recent issue of Vogue, posed by Helmut Newton in a Monte Carlo cardiothoracic hospital. The photographer Steven Meisel, a talent scout, found seven promising glamour girls with perfectly arched eyebrows, and put them on the cover of Italian Vogue last November.","abstract":null,"print_page":"38","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Behind the New Faces"},"keywords":[{"name":"subject","value":"MODELS (PROFESSIONAL)"}],"pub_date":"1992-02-23T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Fashions of The Times Magazine","section_name":"Style; Magazine","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Terry","rank":1,"lastname":"Trucco"}],"original":"By Terry Trucco"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd1b0f08eb7c8105d6d2ca0","word_count":1688},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1992\/02\/23\/nyregion\/westchester-guide-030892.html","snippet":"TRIBUTE TO DEWHURST    Two years ago Colleen Dewhurst was mistress of ceremonies at the Night of Stars fund-raiser for the Northern Westchester Center for the Arts in Goldens Bridge.
