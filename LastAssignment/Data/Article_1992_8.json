The community's External Affairs Commissioner, Frans Andriessen, said he saw signs that Washington and Brussels could soon overcome their impasse on agricultural subsidies. This issue is one of the main stumbling blocks in the six-year-old Uruguay round of talks on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.","abstract":null,"print_page":"11","blog":[],"source":"Reuters","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"U.S.-European Trade Gains Seen as Likely"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"ANDRIESSEN, FRANS"},{"name":"glocations","value":"UNITED STATES"},{"name":"organizations","value":"EUROPEAN COMMUNITY"},{"name":"organizations","value":"GENERAL AGREEMENT ON TARIFFS AND TRADE"},{"name":"subject","value":"INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND WORLD MARKET"}],"pub_date":"1992-10-18T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Foreign Desk","section_name":"World","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd1c3658eb7c8105d6f241f","word_count":175},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1992\/10\/18\/magazine\/food-home-on-the-range.html","snippet":"Riding the Montana range with George Kahrl, one of the rising generation of organic-beef growers, I am conscious of the land, the way it rolls flat and dry and lonesome as an abandoned river bottom.

The plains inch up to foothills that are occasionally seamed by brush-lined creeks and straggly fences. But these demarcations, along with our two horses and a grazing herd of 145 cows (each with a calf), are only passing through, like the wind or a spatter of rain. I adjust my world view accordingly.
