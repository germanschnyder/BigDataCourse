Julio Maria Sanguinetti, the 49-year- old centrist who won November's presidential elections, has promised a program of ''national pacification'' to deal with the legacy of the dictatorship and to dismantle the army's repressive apparatus. At the same time, Uruguay's armed forces are not leaving power in disarray. This month the army commander, Lieut. Gen. Hugo Medina, stirred a political storm by warning that ''if we are obliged, we will have no choice but to carry out another coup d'etat.''","abstract":null,"print_page":"8","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"URUGUAY'S CIVILIAN PRESIDENT TO FACE LEGACY OF ARMY RULE"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"SANGUINETTI, JULIO MARIA"},{"name":"glocations","value":"URUGUAY"},{"name":"subject","value":"ARMAMENT, DEFENSE AND MILITARY FORCES"},{"name":"subject","value":"POLITICS AND GOVERNMENT (1983)"},{"name":"subject","value":"FREEDOM AND HUMAN RIGHTS"}],"pub_date":"1985-03-01T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Foreign Desk","section_name":"World","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Alan","rank":1,"lastname":"RIDING"}],"original":"By ALAN RIDING"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd14eac8eb7c8105d62ea3d","word_count":797},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1985\/03\/01\/world\/white-house-scorns-peace-offer-from-nicaragua.html","snippet":"The White House today called the latest peace overtures from President Daniel Ortega Saavedra of Nicaragua a ''change without substance'' aimed primarily at influencing votes in the United States Congress.

'Contadora Process' Stressed ''I don't know that anything much has changed,'' Mr. Shultz continued, ''though perhaps there is the recognition all round that the center of negotiation must be the Contadora process and that the sooner everyone gets back to that process the better.''

In a series of declarations - to a delegation of Roman Catholic bishops headed by Archbishop John J. O'Connor of New York, to foreign diplomats in Managua, and to fellow Latin American heads of state gathered in Montevideo, Uruguay - President Daniel Ortega Saavedra announced a moratorium on purchases of new weapons systems and promised to send home 100 of the Cuban ''military instructors'' who are assisting his army. By offering what he called ''these immediate and unilateral initiatives and decisions,'' Mr. Ortega was going to the heart of the increasingly tense conflict with Washington: the Administration's conviction that in nearly six years in power, the Sandinistas have turned Nicaragua into a beachhead for Soviet and Cuban subversion and a military threat to the rest of Central America. In a move seen by diplomatic analysts as an attempt to pre-empt Administration strategy, Mr. Ortega also proposed to meet with Secretary of State George P. Shultz and he invited Congressional leaders to send a bipartisan committee to come and see Nicaragua's military installations. The Congressmen were welcome to go anywhere they wanted because, he insisted, ''our miitary preparations are totally and purely defensive.''","abstract":null,"print_page":"1","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"SANDINISTAS PIN HOPES ON CONGRESS"},"keywords":[{"name":"subject","value":"TERMS NOT AVAILABLE"}],"pub_date":"1985-03-03T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Week in Review Desk","section_name":"Week in Review","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Larry","rank":1,"lastname":"ROHTER"}],"original":"By LARRY ROHTER"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd159338eb7c8105d63d9d3","word_count":1026},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1985\/03\/05\/world\/uruguay-ends-censorship.html","snippet":"The new civilian Government declared a formal end today to censorship that the former military regime had imposed on news dispatches sent abroad.
