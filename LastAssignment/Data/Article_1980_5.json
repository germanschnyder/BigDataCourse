The uniform origin of the handbags at Tano of Madrid's leather factory is reflected in the normal 20 percent discounts, compared with prices at other stores, with an additional 25 to 50 percent taken off now during the clearance sale continuing into August. New fall handbags are to go on sale tomorrow at the 20 percent discount. The four-year-old Greenwich branch at 83 Greenwich Avenue carries 35 styles of Spanish-made shoes, along with wares from Argentina, Italy, Uruguay, Sweden and Korea - some at retail prices, some discounted - with prices still lower during these seasonal sales. Branches differ more in types of footwear stocked than in the range of Tano handbags, according to Anthony Di Capua, manager.","abstract":null,"print_page":"Connecticut","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Handbags and Shoes At a Discount","kicker":"THE CAREFUL SHOPPER"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"1980-07-27T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Column 1","section_name":null,"subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"firstname":"Jeanne","middlename":"Clare","lastname":"Feron","rank":1,"role":"reported","organization":""}],"original":"By Jeanne Clare Feron"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd10b468eb7c8105d5befe7","word_count":772},{"web_url":"http:\/\/query.nytimes.com\/gst\/abstract.html?res=9E03E0D71439F93AA15754C0A966948260","snippet":"Peru returned to democratic government today, after 12 years of military rule, with the inauguration of President Fernando Belaunde Terry for a five-year term.
