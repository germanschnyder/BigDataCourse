At a news conference at army headquarters, the Defense Minister, Gen. Jose Guillermo Garcia, widely considered the most powerful member of the Salvadoran Government, said Argentina and El Salvador had traded military missions and that the Chief of Staff of the Salvadoran Army, Col. Rafael Flores Lima, was now in Buenos Aires at the invitation of his Argentine counterpart. He declined to specify Colonel Flores Lima's activities, saying only that the two missions had dealt ''not exclusively with the concrete situation that now concerns us.'' Asserting that the Americans were the only foreign advisers here, he said: ''I am now speaking about the past and the present. In relation to the future I can offer no opinion at all. But I say the future is the future and no one knows what's going to happen in the future.","abstract":null,"print_page":"11","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"SALVADOR MAY USE NON-U.S. ADVISERS"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"SALVADOR, EL"},{"name":"glocations","value":"ARGENTINA"},{"name":"subject","value":"INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS"},{"name":"subject","value":"ARMAMENT, DEFENSE AND MILITARY FORCES"},{"name":"subject","value":"POLITICS AND GOVERNMENT"},{"name":"subject","value":"MILITARY PERSONNEL"}],"pub_date":"1982-02-23T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Foreign Desk","section_name":"World","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Warren","rank":1,"lastname":"HOGE"},{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":2}],"original":"By WARREN HOGE, Special to the New York Times"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd11f158eb7c8105d5de862","word_count":687},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1982\/02\/23\/world\/most-nations-reject-role-in-salvador-election.html","snippet":"Despite strong United States lobbying efforts abroad, only a few of the 60 nations that have received invitations from the Salvadoran Government have agreed to send observers to an election for a constituent assembly on March 28.

According to diplomats here, most invited governments are wary of arousing adverse public opinion at home by appearing to support balloting that the Salvadoran junta is arranging and that the insurgents say they will boycott. Both the Reagan Administration and the Salvadorans are counting on the election to give the junta wider respect. The assembly is to draft a constitution and pave the way for the election of a government, possibly next year.","abstract":null,"print_page":"11","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"MOST NATIONS REJECT ROLE IN SALVADOR ELECTION"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"SALVADOR, EL"},{"name":"subject","value":"INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS"},{"name":"subject","value":"POLITICS AND GOVERNMENT"},{"name":"subject","value":"ELECTIONS"}],"pub_date":"1982-02-23T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Foreign Desk","section_name":"World","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Barbara","rank":1,"lastname":"CROSSETTE"},{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":2}],"original":"By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to the New York Times"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd121268eb7c8105d5e28a7","word_count":590},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1982\/03\/02\/world\/team-of-observers-for-salvadoran-vote-announced-by-us.html","snippet":"The State Department announced today that Senator Nancy L.

The soldiers, who arrived from Pope Air Force Base in North Carolina aboard two Boeing 747 jumbo jets of El Al Israel Airlines, marched nine miles from the airfield to the force's new base just south of Na'ama Bay, according to a spokesman for the force. A United States Air Force C-141 cargo plane also arrived with weapons and other equipment, he said.

HALFWAY through this metaphysical ghost story we become deliciously confused. Are we in the imagination of a Henry James, where ghosts are psychological projections of inner states? Are we exploring, as in Balzac, the elder Dumas, and Poe, edges of reality where reason frays into myth and fantasy? Or has reality been distorted into strangeness just enough, as in Luis Bunuel, to whom this novel is dedicated, to sharpen our attention? Carlos Fuentes in all his books draws tight a tense conjunction of opposites: the sensuously beautiful and the horrifyingly ugly, innocence and evil, past and present, the familiar and the strange, nature and culture. In ''Distant Relations,'' a novel in which two boys fuse into one and a man disintegrates in a shower of dead leaves, these tensions operate in a cat's cradle of a plot, crisscrossing each other to make a puzzle worthy of Poe or Borges.","abstract":null,"print_page":"3","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"THE NOVEL: A CONJUNCTION OF OPPOSITES"},"keywords":[{"name":"subject","value":"BOOKS AND LITERATURE"}],"pub_date":"1982-03-21T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Book Review Desk","section_name":"Arts; Books","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Guy","rank":1,"lastname":"DAVENPORT"}],"original":"By GUY DAVENPORT; Guy Davenport teaches English at the University of Kentucky.
