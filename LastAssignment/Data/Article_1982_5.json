Though there are no signs that President Leopoldo Galtieri or the junta as a whole has planned a conscious public relations campaign aimed at Argentine opinion, the thrust of what is being printed and broadcast has been that Argentine planes and troops are thrashing the British. Conviccion, a newspaper that has ties to the navy, had a headline today on the British landing at Port San Carlos that said, ''The marines, immobilized at San Carlos, await their Dunkirk.'' A smaller headline adds, ''As Argentine troops concentrate to throw them into the sea, the British continue in the little beachhead without resupply.''","abstract":null,"print_page":"7","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"PRESS TELLS ARGENTINES THAT THEY ARE WINNING"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"FALKLAND ISLANDS"},{"name":"glocations","value":"GREAT BRITAIN"},{"name":"glocations","value":"ARGENTINA"},{"name":"subject","value":"ARMAMENT, DEFENSE AND MILITARY FORCES"},{"name":"subject","value":"BOUNDARIES AND TERRITORIAL ISSUES"},{"name":"subject","value":"NEWS AND NEWS MEDIA"}],"pub_date":"1982-05-24T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Foreign Desk","section_name":"World","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1}],"original":"By JAMES M.
