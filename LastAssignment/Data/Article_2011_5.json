Her finds have included antique whalebone poker chips in Montevideo, Uruguay, textiles from a Guatemalan village and vintage arrows at a flea market in rural Texas. This inspiration from travel is delightfully apparent in her resort collection, \u201cParadise Is an Island.\u201d The assortment is a tropical concoction of polychromatic glass beads, winsome brass arrowheads and carnelian tusks, all strung together on gold chains and rope \u2014 the perfect colorful addition to an urbanite\u2019s summer wardrobe. Despite each piece having names of exotic vacation hot spots, like \u201cEaster Island Necklace,\u201d the root of the label could not be more down-to-earth. For Fortunato, jewelry has always been a natural outlet. \u201cBy the time I was in college, I was fashioning statement necklaces out of industrial bolts and chains, glass beads that a friend toted back from South Africa and family heirloom pieces \u2014 literally anything I could get my hands on,\u201d she explains. The results are a fusion of high and low, with thoughtful handiwork and smart combinations of pearls, colorful rope and shapely gold.","abstract":"Fortunato\u2019s jewelry collection for resort was inspired by her travel to Uruguay, Guatemala and Texas.","print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Don\u2019t Forget Resort Jewels | Lizzie Fortunato","kicker":"T Magazine"},"keywords":[{"rank":"1","name":"type_of_material","value":"News"}],"pub_date":"2011-06-23T16:18:27Z","document_type":"blogpost","news_desk":null,"section_name":null,"subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Madison","rank":1,"lastname":"SHIMODA"}],"original":"By MADISON SHIMODA"},"type_of_material":"Blog","_id":"4fd39fb48eb7c8105d8e4183","word_count":"194"},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2011\/06\/28\/sports\/mark-gerard-76-veterinarian-at-center-of-a-horse-race-fraud.html","snippet":"Dr. Gerard cared for champions like Kelso and Secretariat but imported a horse that ran as a ringer who won at odds of 57 to 1.","lead_paragraph":"Dr. Gerard cared for champions like Kelso and Secretariat but imported a horse that ran as a ringer who won at odds of 57 to 1.","abstract":"Mark J Gerard, veterinarian who cared for champion race horses and was involved in a notorious 1970s horse identity switch, dies at age 76.","print_page":"16","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"width":75,"url":"images\/2011\/06\/28\/sports\/OBIT-GERARD\/OBIT-GERARD-thumbStandard.jpg","height":75,"subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"thumbnailheight":"75","thumbnail":"images\/2011\/06\/28\/sports\/OBIT-GERARD\/OBIT-GERARD-thumbStandard.jpg","thumbnailwidth":"75"},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"seo":"Mark Gerard, 76, Veterinarian at Center of a Horse Race Fraud","main":"Mark Gerard, Veterinarian at Center of a Horse Race Fraud, Dies at 76","print_headline":"Mark J.
