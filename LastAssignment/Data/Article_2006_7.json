''In this day and age, you're not going to get a fair shake in the media,'' said Armstrong, who rode his bike for charity yesterday at Indianapolis Motor Speedway. ''And the more you get out there and talk about it, I have to talk about it. The best is just to let the process play out and get out of the media. I would have encouraged him just to lay low.'' Landis, who once competed on Armstrong's team, appeared on ''The Tonight Show'' this week and has given interviews on all four major network morning shows. He has cited a variety of possible reasons for his failed test. COLLEGE FOOTBALL RICE HEADLINES HALL CLASS -- College seems like a blur to Jerry Rice. ''It went by so fast,'' said Rice, who was a receiver at Mississippi Valley State. ''You're so focused. I wish I could go back and do it all over again.'' That was a common feeling among the 20 men enshrined yesterday into the College Football Hall of Fame in South Bend, Ind. Alabama linebacker Cornelius Bennett, Pittsburgh offensive tackle Mark May and Oklahoma running back Joe Washington said they would love to live those days again. Even fullback Roosevelt Leaks, who faced obstacles in becoming the first black all-American football player at Texas, said he would gladly do it again. ''We all travel different roads,'' he said. ''Whether it was a tougher road or not, there are always obstacles on the road. You keep moving forward. The things that deter you, they usually make you better.'' Others inducted into the hall included Southern California tailback Anthony Davis, the Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback John Huarte of Notre Dame, Stanford defensive tackle Paul Wiggin and Michigan defensive back Tom Curtis, along with the former Auburn coach Pat Dye and the former West Virginia coach Don Nehlen. HORSE RACING GO DEPUTY WINS AT SARATOGA -- Go Deputy raced three wide on the turn and took the lead to win the $500,000 Sword Dancer Invitational by two lengths over Silver Whistle yesterday at Saratoga Race Course. Winning for the sixth time in 16 career starts, Go Deputy, trained by Todd Pletcher and ridden by Eibar Coa, ran in 2:26.3 on the turf, returning $15.40 for a $2 bet to win. Earlier, War Front won the $200,000 Alfred G. Vanderbilt Breeders Cup Handicap by two and a half lengths. THE TIN MAN WINS MILLION -- The Tin Man broke first from the gate and led the entire way yesterday to win the Arlington Million in Arlington Heights, Ill. The Tin Man, an 8-year-old gelding trained by Richard Mandella and ridden by Victor Espinoza, set the pace early and held off a late charge from Cacique in the stretch to win by a length. BASKETBALL NOWITZKI LEADS GERMANY -- Dirk Nowitzki scored 18 points to lead Germany to a 76-75 victory against Brazil yesterday in a world championships warm-up in Nanjing, China. Cleveland Cavaliers center Anderson Varejao had 25 points for Brazil. Nowitzki, the Dallas Mavericks star, added 16 rebounds. In the earlier game, Tony Parker led France back from a first-half deficit to down European champion Greece, 72-68. Parker, the San Antonio Spurs guard, had 6 points and 3 assists. SKY SETS RECORD WITH LOSS -- The expansion Chicago Sky (4-29) set a W.N.B.A. record with their 29th loss of the season last night, an 84-57 defeat against the host Charlotte Sting. Charlotte had set the mark with a 6-28 record last season. Washington has the worst winning percentage in league history -- 3-27 (.100) in 1998. TRACK AND FIELD RUSSIAN WINS POLE VAULT -- Yelena Isinbayeva of Russia added to her collection of gold medals from major meets yesterday when she won the women's pole vault at the European Championships in Goteborg, Sweden. Isinbayeva, the reigning Olympic and world champion, cleared 15 feet 9 inches for a meet record, then failed in three attempts to beat her world record of 16 feet 5 1\/4 inches in rainy conditions. HOCKEY RUSSIAN PROSPECT LEAVES TEAM -- Evgeni Malkin, the star forward and Pittsburgh Penguins draft pick who has said repeatedly he wants to play in the N.H.L., left his Russian pro team during a training camp in Finland yesterday, various Russian news services reported. Malkin was the No. 2 pick in the 2004 draft behind last year's N.H.L. rookie of the year, his fellow Russian Alexander Ovechkin. But he did not play in the N.H.L. last season because the league lacked a transfer agreement with the Russian ice hockey federation. RUGBY CANADA DOMINATES U.S. -- The United States rugby team was routed by Canada, 56-7, yesterday in St. John's, Newfoundland, giving the Canadians a spot in next year's World Cup and sending the Americans to a regional playoff against Uruguay.","abstract":"Lance Armstrong says Tour de France winner Floyd Landis should refrain from speaking to media about positive drug tests (S)","print_page":"11","blog":[],"source":"AP","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Sports Briefing"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"ARMSTRONG, LANCE"},{"name":"persons","value":"LANDIS, FLOYD"},{"name":"subject","value":"DOPING (SPORTS)"},{"name":"subject","value":"BICYCLES AND BICYCLING"},{"name":"subject","value":"TESTS AND TESTING"},{"name":"subject","value":"TOUR DE FRANCE (BICYCLE RACE)"},{"name":"subject","value":"NEWS AND NEWS MEDIA"}],"pub_date":"2006-08-13T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Sports Desk","section_name":null,"subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd253098eb7c8105d7f907b","word_count":835},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2006\/08\/16\/world\/americas\/16cnd-stroessner.html","snippet":"South America\u2019s most enduring dictator during the cold war was 93.","lead_paragraph":"South America\u2019s most enduring dictator during the cold war was 93.","abstract":null,"print_page":null,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"width":600,"url":"images\/2006\/08\/16\/obituaries\/16cnd_Strossner.600.jpg","height":258,"subtype":"xlarge","legacy":{"xlargewidth":"600","xlarge":"images\/2006\/08\/16\/obituaries\/16cnd_Strossner.600.jpg","xlargeheight":"258"},"type":"image"},{"width":75,"url":"images\/2006\/08\/16\/obituaries\/16cnd_7575.jpg","height":75,"subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"thumbnailheight":"75","thumbnail":"images\/2006\/08\/16\/obituaries\/16cnd_7575.jpg","thumbnailwidth":"75"},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"main":"Stroessner, Paraguay\u2019s Enduring Dictator, Dies"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"2006-08-16T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"ContinuousNews","section_name":"World","subsection_name":"Americas","byline":{"person":[{"firstname":"Diana","middlename":"Jean","lastname":"SCHEMO","rank":1,"role":"reported","organization":""}],"original":"By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"54b0e5ab38f0d8367c8428db","word_count":"2466"},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2006\/08\/17\/world\/americas\/17stroessner.html","snippet":"General Stroessner, South America\u2019s most enduring dictator during the cold war, died in exile.","lead_paragraph":"General Stroessner, South America\u2019s most enduring dictator during the cold war, died in exile.","abstract":null,"print_page":"7","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"width":600,"url":"images\/2006\/08\/16\/obituaries\/16cnd_Strossner.600.jpg","height":258,"subtype":"xlarge","legacy":{"xlargewidth":"600","xlarge":"images\/2006\/08\/16\/obituaries\/16cnd_Strossner.600.jpg","xlargeheight":"258"},"type":"image"},{"width":75,"url":"images\/2006\/08\/16\/obituaries\/16cnd_7575.jpg","height":75,"subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"thumbnailheight":"75","thumbnail":"images\/2006\/08\/16\/obituaries\/16cnd_7575.jpg","thumbnailwidth":"75"},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"main":"Alfredo Stroessner, 93, Paraguayan Ex-Dictator, Dies","print_headline":"Gen.
