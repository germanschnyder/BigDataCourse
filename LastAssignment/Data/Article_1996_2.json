For her legions of fans around the world, Ms. Plisetskaya has long been enshrined as one of this century's greatest ballerinas. For the petite and famously combative Russian star, though, what really counts is that at the age of 70 she is still dancing. And when she is not on the road, she spends 45 minutes in the morning exercising and rehearsing alongside dancers young enough to be her grandchildren.","abstract":null,"print_page":"11","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"A Russian Legend Carries On Without Russia","kicker":"DANCE"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"PLISETSKAYA, MAYA MAYA MIKHAILOVNA PLISETSKAYA"},{"name":"glocations","value":"RUSSIA"},{"name":"subject","value":"BIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION"},{"name":"subject","value":"DANCING"}],"pub_date":"1996-05-05T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Arts and Leisure Desk","section_name":"Arts","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Alan","rank":1,"lastname":"RIDING"}],"original":"By ALAN RIDING"},"type_of_material":"Biography","_id":"4fd1c84f8eb7c8105d6fab29","word_count":1571},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1996\/05\/25\/business\/us-hints-about-a-withdrawal-from-talks-on-maritime-trade.html","snippet":"The United States signaled today that it was withdrawing from the negotiations to liberalize world trade in maritime services, diplomats said, dealing another blow to the fledgling World Trade Organization.

They say this violates pledges that the waterway's construction would depend on the outcome of environmental studies. The five-country consortium behind the Hydrovia project, a waterway that would run from Caceres, Brazil, to Punta del Este, Uruguay, says it is awaiting results of a comprehensive environmental impact study, which is expected to be completed this year, before beginning work. The project calls for straightening and dredging the rivers, controlling the flow of tributaries with dikes and removing rock formations to allow year-round shipping.","abstract":null,"print_page":"10","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Ecologists Criticize First Steps in Latin River Plan"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"PARAGUAY"},{"name":"glocations","value":"LATIN AMERICA"},{"name":"glocations","value":"PARAGUAY RIVER"},{"name":"glocations","value":"PARANA RIVER"},{"name":"subject","value":"WATERWAYS AND OTHER BODIES OF WATER"},{"name":"subject","value":"ENVIRONMENT"}],"pub_date":"1996-05-26T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Foreign Desk","section_name":"World","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"firstname":"Diana","middlename":"Jean","lastname":"SCHEMO","rank":1,"role":"reported","organization":""}],"original":"By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd1d3778eb7c8105d70fccc","word_count":535},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1996\/05\/28\/sports\/soccer-report.html","snippet":"Major League Soccer","lead_paragraph":"Major League Soccer","abstract":null,"print_page":"10","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"SOCCER REPORT"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"LOS ANGELES, CA, USA"},{"name":"subject","value":"SOCCER"}],"pub_date":"1996-05-28T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Sports Desk","section_name":"Sports","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Alex","rank":1,"lastname":"YANNIS"}],"original":"By ALEX YANNIS"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd207148eb7c8105d770c0b","word_count":852},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1996\/05\/30\/us\/jerry-r-junkins-58-dies-headed-texas-instruments.html","snippet":"Jerry R.
