In all the major countries, including this one, the recessions of the 1990's have proved to be deeper and more tenacious than the consensus forecasts of economists or governments. What distinguishes the present slump from earlier postwar dips are the structural drags, especially the huge public and private debts and the inflated asset values built in the careless and speculative boom of the 1980's. \"The unwinding of an asset-driven credit mania is always longer and more difficult than observers and economic actors at first believe,\" said Kenneth S.

The Uruguay Round of trade talks, begun five years ago, was designed to forge a grand bargain. The third world would agree to rules governing foreign investment, services, copyrights and patents.
