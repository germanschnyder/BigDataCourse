At the water's edge the protruding eyes of caimans float just above the surface. Glistening like marbles, they duck underwater in a soundless vertical drop as we pass their field of vision. There is something hypnotic and frightening about the utter completeness of their disappearance, leaving just a momentary bubble or two behind.
