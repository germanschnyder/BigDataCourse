But to musical theater lovers, it is recognized as the Spanish variety of operetta. Until recently, most of us had to content ourselves with the tantalizing morsels recorded by nearly every notable singer of Spanish extraction, including Victoria de los Angeles, Teresa Berganza, Montserrat Caballe, Alfred Kraus and Placido Domingo. Most have sung zarzuela in Spain and have often included zarzuela excerpts in their concerts here. This week sees a significant boost in New York's exposure to this Iberian specialty with the appearance on Wednesday and Thursday at Madison Square Garden of Mr. Domingo at the head of the Spanish revue, the ''Antologia de la Zarzuela.'' This follows the new production at the Repertorio Espanol, more modestly scaled, of the classic 1932 zarzuela, ''Luisa Fernanda.''","abstract":null,"print_page":"9","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"SPAIN'S STYLE OF OPERETTA GOES ON DISPLAY"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"TRAUBER, RICHARD"},{"name":"persons","value":"DOMINGO, PLACIDO"},{"name":"subject","value":"MUSIC"},{"name":"subject","value":"CONCERTS AND RECITALS"}],"pub_date":"1985-08-04T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Arts and Leisure Desk","section_name":"Arts","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Richard","rank":1,"lastname":"Traubner"}],"original":"By Richard Traubner; Richard Traubner, author of ''Operetta: A Theatrical History'' (Doubleday), writes frequently on musical theater and film"},"type_of_material":"Review","_id":"4fd1521b8eb7c8105d63460f","word_count":1667},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1985\/08\/09\/sports\/becker-is-eliminated.html","snippet":"The Wimbledon champion, Boris Becker, was eliminated from the $150,000 Kitzbuehel Head Cup Tournament today in a 6-3, 6-1 first-round loss to Diego Perez of Uruguay.

''We do not believe that the solution is by way of the removal of a legitimately constituted Government,'' Mr. Sepulveda said.
