At stake was more than $4 million, to be divided among the six United States teams -if all would agree to it. But two refused. Philip Morris wanted to organize a series of 12-Meter races in June among the syndicates, with substantial prize money going to the winners. The boat that placed first in the three-day regatta (planned for San Francisco Bay) would win $1.6 million. The second prize would be $1.1 million; third, $600,000; fourth, $350,000; fifth, $250,000, and last, $200,000. The program was devised to promote one of Philip Morris's brand of cigarettes.","abstract":null,"print_page":"9","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"COMPANY'S OFFER DIVIDES SYNDICATES"},"keywords":[{"name":"creative_works","value":"AMERICA'S CUP"},{"name":"organizations","value":"PHILIP MORRIS INC"},{"name":"subject","value":"RACES AND REGATTAS"},{"name":"subject","value":"BOATS AND BOATING"}],"pub_date":"1986-02-23T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Sports Desk","section_name":"Sports","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Barbara","rank":1,"lastname":"LLOYD"}],"original":"By BARBARA LLOYD"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd156518eb7c8105d63a79e","word_count":670},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1986\/02\/25\/business\/oil-slump-delays-baker-plan.html","snippet":"More than four months ago, Treasury Secretary James A.

Baker 3d proposed a new way for the rich countries to help the poor countries cope with their huge debts. It was a program, analysts said then, that offered the least possible pain to all. Since then, however, not a single debtor has signed on for the ''Baker plan,'' as the proposal quickly became known. And now analysts say that the fall in oil prices and other new perturbations in the international economy could require stop-gap aid for the debtors that would delay implementation of the plan even longer. ''Unless all parties come together in reasonably short order and with real credibility,'' the Morgan Guaranty Bank writes in a new assessment of the plan, ''it will be difficult to translate the Baker initiative into a workable plan, let alone into working practice.''","abstract":null,"print_page":"1","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"OIL SLUMP DELAYS 'BAKER PLAN'"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"BAKER, JAMES A 3D"},{"name":"glocations","value":"LATIN AMERICA"},{"name":"glocations","value":"UNITED STATES"},{"name":"glocations","value":"THIRD WORLD AND DEVELOPING COUNTRIES"},{"name":"subject","value":"PRICES"},{"name":"subject","value":"OIL (PETROLEUM) AND GASOLINE"},{"name":"subject","value":"CREDIT"},{"name":"subject","value":"ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND TRENDS"}],"pub_date":"1986-02-25T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Financial Desk","section_name":"Business","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"firstname":"Peter","middlename":"T.","lastname":"KILBORN","rank":1,"role":"reported","organization":""},{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":2}],"original":"By PETER T.

Baker 3d, Secretary of the Treasury, and Paul A. Volcker, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, as the Reagan Administration signaled it had moved closer to supporting aid for the country because of the oil price slump. Papers called ''talking points,'' put out by the State and Treasury Departments, said the program outlined by President Miguel de la Madrid of Mexico last Friday ''indicates Mexico's intentions to come to grips with the new realities created by the decline in oil prices.'' This is considered the most positive statement the Administration has made on Mexican economic policy.

''The real issue is the impact of the price cuts on the growth rates in the industrial world and on interest rates,'' said Christine Bindert, a senior vice president at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. who has worked as an economic adviser for several Latin American governments. To be sure, developing nations -just like the United States and other industrialized countries - cannot know just how much they will benefit from falling oil prices until they see how far the price decline goes and how long it lasts. Nonetheless, economists estimate that the decline in prices should add between one-half of 1 percent and 1 percent to the growth rate of the economies of industrialized nations this year. That should in turn increase demand for Latin American, African and Asian manufactured goods and commodities.","abstract":null,"print_page":"1","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"OIL IMPACT ON POORER NATIONS"},"keywords":[{"name":"subject","value":"SURVEYS AND SERIES"},{"name":"subject","value":"INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND WORLD MARKET"},{"name":"subject","value":"PRICES"},{"name":"subject","value":"OIL (PETROLEUM) AND GASOLINE"},{"name":"subject","value":"FORECASTS"},{"name":"subject","value":"ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND TRENDS"},{"name":"subject","value":"THIRD WORLD AND DEVELOPING COUNTRIES"}],"pub_date":"1986-02-28T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Financial Desk","section_name":"Business","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"firstname":"Barnaby","middlename":"J.","lastname":"FEDER","rank":1,"role":"reported","organization":""}],"original":"By BARNABY J.

Shultz faced a skeptical Senate Foreign Relations Committee today as he urged approval of President Reagan's request for $100 million to help the Nicaraguan rebels. The authorization would include $70 million in military and $30 million in nonlethal aid to the guerrillas, known as contras. Congress cut off covert military aid to the rebels in 1984 and approved $27 million in the current fiscal year for food, medical supplies and other nonlethal support. Under close questioning by dubious senators, Mr. Shultz conceded that only $18 million of that had been spent so far, mainly because of resistance by Honduras to its territory being used as a conduit for supplies.","abstract":null,"print_page":"6","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"SHULTZ ASSAILS NICARAGUA IN ASKING AID FOR REBELS"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"REAGAN, RONALD WILSON"},{"name":"persons","value":"SHULTZ, GEORGE PRATT"},{"name":"glocations","value":"NICARAGUA"},{"name":"organizations","value":"SENATE COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN RELATIONS"},{"name":"subject","value":"UNITED STATES INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS"},{"name":"subject","value":"ARMAMENT, DEFENSE AND MILITARY FORCES"},{"name":"subject","value":"CIVIL WAR AND GUERRILLA WARFARE"},{"name":"subject","value":"FOREIGN AID"},{"name":"subject","value":"UNITED STATES ARMAMENT AND DEFENSE"}],"pub_date":"1986-02-28T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Foreign Desk","section_name":"World; Washington","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"firstname":"David","middlename":"K.","lastname":"SHIPLER","rank":1,"role":"reported","organization":""},{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":2}],"original":"By DAVID K.

The restructuring agreement, which also stretches out the repayment of some of the loans, was reached Saturday night after about a month of negotiations. The accord came one day after Brazil's President, Jose Sarney, ordered sweeping economic changes to combat inflation. The restructuring proposal also comes while banks are under increasing pressure to ease the debt service burden on developing nations.

Translated from the Spanish by Gabriela Arciniegas and R. Victoria Arana. 298 pages. Harcourt Brace Jovanovich. $19.95. FROM the moment Europeans discovered America, it began to modify their lives, their politics, their economies, their ideas. Even more importantly, perhaps, by confirming their hopes, it raised fresh ones. It was a dream come true - not exactly in the way that had been anticipated, but palpably enough to hold out the possibility that many other dreams might come true as well. In ''America in Europe'' German Arciniegas argues that the influence of the New World on the Old has been neglected by historians. In taking it as his subject, he has set himself a daunting task; to measure its full extent would indeed be to calculate the incalculable. But Mr. Arciniegas, a veteran Colombian man of letters, is too shrewd to let himself get drawn into attempting an exhaustive survey. Instead, he concentrates on a few major themes and episodes. His aim, as he says, is ''above all to promote another choice - a new perspective.''","abstract":null,"print_page":"29","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"BOOKS OF THE TIMES"},"keywords":[{"name":"creative_works","value":"AMERICA IN EUROPE (BOOK)"},{"name":"persons","value":"ARCINIEGAS, GERMAN"},{"name":"subject","value":"BOOK REVIEWS"}],"pub_date":"1986-03-07T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Weekend Desk","section_name":"Arts; Books","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"John","rank":1,"lastname":"Gross"}],"original":"By John Gross"},"type_of_material":"Review","_id":"4fd16b228eb7c8105d65bddb","word_count":960}]},"status":"OK","copyright":"Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
