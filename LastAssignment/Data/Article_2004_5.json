A10 Dealing With Arafat's Absence The Israeli cabinet and Palestinian officials held separate gatherings to discuss how to respond to the absence of Yasir Arafat, who remains hospitalized in France with an undiagnosed illness. A1 Afghan Hostage Video Militants holding three foreign United Nations staff members in Afghanistan released a videotape showing their hostages, who they said would be killed if demands for the withdrawal of foreign troops were not met by noon Wednesday. A11 Elections in 3 Countries In Ukraine, as voters cast their ballots to elect a successor to President Leonid D. Kuchma, left, there were accusations of harassment and electoral irregularities that called into question the fairness of the election. Initial vote counts showed substantially different results.

A11 NATIONAL A12-22 Candidates Sprint Toward Finish Line in Dead Heat The presidential campaign is coming to a close in an epic, $60 million cacophony of advertisements striking notes of hope and fear, patriotism and betrayal as the candidates head into a final attempt to sway an electorate. A1 President Bush's playful optimism has become part of his campaign's playbook as he hurtles toward Election Day without showing strain despite having no clear evidence if he will be rehired, fired or placed in recount limbo. A1 Senator John Kerry has been relaxed and playful yet workmanlike, focused and visibly weary in the final days of the campaign, replacing the serious persona he has displayed on the campaign trail. A1 Vice President Dick Cheney's core message, that Mr. Kerry will ''say or do anything'' to get elected, has been repeated in every appearance for the last few weeks. But it may not be breaking through in the press as much Republicans would like because of the repetition. A21 Senator John Edwards, a former trial lawyer, has been boiling down his message to what sounds like last-minute instructions to the jury. A21 The final New York Times\/CBS News poll of the 2004 campaign shows that Mr. Bush and Mr. Kerry remain in a statistical tie. A16 Many Christian conservatives say that President Bush and his administration have done more to excite churchgoing voters than any previous administration and that the results of the election may determine their influence in the Republican Party for years to come. A22 Crowd Control Concerns The death of a 21-year-old college student outside Fenway Park in October is only the latest reminder that crowd control has returned as one of the toughest challenges for the police nationwide. A12 Prisoner Rights Debated What the Supreme Court justices meant in their June ruling on how far the government must go to accommodate the Guant\u00e1namo prisoners has produced a sharp debate now being played out in lower courts.

Toolan III. Mr. Toolan is a suspect in her fatal stabbing. B1 New Water Violations Three years after New York City's Department of Environmental Protection pleaded guilty to violating the nation's environmental laws after discharging mercury-contaminated water for two years into a pool that flowed into an upstate reservoir, and allowing employees to use machinery contaminated with PCB's, a new report lists further violations.

But in the rest of the art world, the next two weeks will be particularly stressful as art valued at more than half a billion dollars goes on the market in the important fall sales. E1 Gamble for Theater Pays Off When Nicholas Hytner, the artistic director of the National Theater in London, cut the cost of tickets for the Olivier to about the price of a movie, he knew it was a gamble. Now after a year and a half it is clear that Mr. Hytner's plan is a winner. E3 R. Kelly Dropped From Tour Even as a disagreement between R. Kelly, and Jay-Z continues to rage, their new album, ''Unfinished Business,'' is poised to enter the Billboard charts at No. 1 this week. That fact does not sit well with Jay-Z, who had Mr. Kelly kicked off their ''Best of Both Worlds'' tour on Saturday, just one day after Mr. Kelly accused a member of Jay-Z's entourage of attacking him with pepper spray.
