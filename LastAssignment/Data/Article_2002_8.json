How does a professor of Latin and Greek classics find fulfillment and fame writing about prostitutes? Why does he live in Cuba, where some people whisper that he arrived 33 years ago on a hijacked flight? And how can he slam back four double shots of smooth, amber rum before noon and not fall flat on his face? Mr. Chavarr\u00eda says the answers to some of those questions (though perhaps not the last one) are in his books, most notably ''Adios Muchachos'' (Akashic Books, 2001), which won an Edgar Award this year. But his feat of liquid endurance prompts him to reveal one clue.","abstract":"Article profiles Cuban crime novelist Daniel Chavarria, whose latest book, Adios Muchachos, won Edgar Award this year; interview; photos; 68-year-old classics professor was born in Uruguay and came to Cuba in 1969 (M)","print_page":"1","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"A Wry Cuban Writer as Mysterious as His Plots"},"keywords":[{"name":"creative_works","value":"ADIOS MUCHACHOS (BOOK)"},{"name":"persons","value":"CHAVARRIA,DANIEL"},{"name":"glocations","value":"CUBA"},{"name":"subject","value":"BOOKS AND LITERATURE"},{"name":"subject","value":"BIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION"},{"name":"subject","value":"EDGAR ALLAN POE AWARDS"}],"pub_date":"2002-07-04T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"The Arts\/Cultural Desk","section_name":"Arts; Books","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"David","rank":1,"lastname":"GONZALEZ"}],"original":"By DAVID GONZALEZ"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd232a38eb7c8105d7c2686","word_count":1028},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2002\/07\/04\/business\/mexico-and-brazil-sign-bilateral-trade-pact.html","snippet":"With prospects for global trade liberalization looking bleak at the moment, the presidents of Brazil and Mexico, Latin America's two biggest economies, signed a bilateral trade deal today instead, opening their markets to each other in 800 industrial...","lead_paragraph":"With prospects for global trade liberalization looking bleak at the moment, the presidents of Brazil and Mexico, Latin America's two biggest economies, signed a bilateral trade deal today instead, opening their markets to each other in 800 industrial and agricultural product categories.

Buffett is close to a deal to invest as much as $500 million in the Williams Companies, the energy concern, executives close to the talks said. The move would be his second major investment in the debt-ridden energy sector this week and would help keep Williams from filing for bankruptcy protection. The transaction would give Mr. Buffett's MidAmerican Energy Holdings, a unit of Berkshire Hathaway, preferred stock in Williams that would be secured by pipeline assets. Mr. Buffett appears to be nearly alone in his effort to buy energy assets, trying to take advantage of the decimated stock and debt-filled balance sheets of energy companies. [Page C5.] G.E.
