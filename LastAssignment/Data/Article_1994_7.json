Security Council resolution authorizing a U.S.-led invasion will have done some good. The resolution contains no deadline, and the Clinton Administration has no plans for an imminent military strike. Perhaps only the threat of force will convince Haiti's top soldiers they should depart. They viscerally oppose the social and economic changes they believe President Jean-Bertrand Aristide would make if he returns. And they are reportedly profiting handsomely from the status quo.","abstract":null,"print_page":"20","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"A U.N.

It threatened to retaliate unless Japan reversed government procurement policies that discriminate against exports of U.S. telecommunications and medical equipment. And it bludgeoned Canada into agreeing to reduce wheat exports to the U.S. for a year while a commission reviews an ongoing dispute about such exports. The fighting stance toward Japan is justified, though the Administration threatens to carry it to excess. The decision to shut out Canadian wheat, by contrast, amounts to an assault on U.S. consumers -- the price of Mr. Clinton's promise to bail out Midwestern farmers whose support he desperately needed in Congress to pass the North American Free Trade Agreement.","abstract":null,"print_page":"22","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Right and Wrong on Trade"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"CLINTON, BILL"},{"name":"glocations","value":"JAPAN"},{"name":"glocations","value":"CANADA"},{"name":"subject","value":"INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND WORLD MARKET"},{"name":"subject","value":"EDITORIALS"},{"name":"subject","value":"PROTECTIONISM (TRADE)"},{"name":"subject","value":"MEDICINE AND HEALTH"},{"name":"subject","value":"GRAIN"},{"name":"subject","value":"TELEPHONES AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS"}],"pub_date":"1994-08-04T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Editorial Desk","section_name":"Health; Opinion","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"Editorial","_id":"4fd1e6628eb7c8105d732964","word_count":452},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1994\/08\/05\/business\/tariff-accord-by-latin-group.html","snippet":"The Mercosur trade bloc countries of South America reached an agreement today on common external tariffs that are to take effect on Jan. 1, a Uruguayan official said.   \"We believe we are in a position to announce the details of the common external...","lead_paragraph":"The Mercosur trade bloc countries of South America reached an agreement today on common external tariffs that are to take effect on Jan. 1, a Uruguayan official said. \"We believe we are in a position to announce the details of the common external tariff tomorrow,\" Foreign Minister Sergio Abreu of Uruguay said.","abstract":null,"print_page":"15","blog":[],"source":"Reuters","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Tariff Accord By Latin Group"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"PARAGUAY"},{"name":"glocations","value":"BRAZIL"},{"name":"glocations","value":"ARGENTINA"},{"name":"glocations","value":"URUGUAY"},{"name":"subject","value":"INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND WORLD MARKET"},{"name":"subject","value":"TREATIES"},{"name":"subject","value":"CUSTOMS (TARIFF)"}],"pub_date":"1994-08-05T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Financial Desk","section_name":"Business","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"News","_id":"52b8692838f0d8094087d68f","word_count":"156"},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1994\/08\/05\/sports\/soccer-ramos-still-recuperating-gives-young-fans-a-thrill.html","snippet":"If he tries to pick up anything heavy, he gets a headache.

Or at least that's the way it has been for the last half a century -- and the way it was when the Clinton Administration did battle to win passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement last year. But to the surprise and anguish of many who wish to bring down trade barriers, the White House is doing little to fight protectionist provisions in the legislation that must be enacted to underpin the new GATT pact.

The sailboat's low, flat hull set the yacht apart from others in the bay. With a plumb bow sticking straight up from the water, a saucer-shaped stern and a splash of corporate graphics on the top, this had to be a racing boat. But what was the name?
