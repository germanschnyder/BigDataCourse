Participants were a high-level group, from government and business in a wide range of countries. Their outlook was so gloomy that some American Democrats wondered out loud why candidates in their party were trying so hard to take over responsibility for the Reagan legacy. Remarkably, there was almost complete consensus on what is wrong and what should be done about it - so, little new on diagnosis and prescription. But the shift of mood came from another consensus: that decision makers simply aren't going to take sensible measures until they are forced by crisis. Some of these officials and businessmen have reached a point where they almost hope for crisis, a serious jolt that will oblige leaders to tell the facts of world economic life to the public and to act before the damage is overwhelming.","abstract":null,"print_page":"27","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Borrowed Time","kicker":"FOREIGN AFFAIRS"},"keywords":[{"name":"organizations","value":"ASPEN INSTITUTE FOR HUMANISTIC STUDIES"},{"name":"subject","value":"ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND TRENDS"}],"pub_date":"1986-09-05T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Editorial Desk","section_name":"Opinion","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Flora","rank":1,"lastname":"Lewis"}],"original":"By Flora Lewis"},"type_of_material":"Op-Ed","_id":"4fd156a78eb7c8105d63b362","word_count":766},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1986\/09\/07\/world\/us-issues-threat-in-talks-on-trade.html","snippet":"A senior Reagan Administration official warned today that the United States would pull out of planned new global trade talks this month unless other nations gave priority to freeing trade in two key areas for the American economy.

The United States Trade Representative, Clayton K. Yeutter, said at a news conference here that the two key areas were agricultural goods and services like banking and telecommunications. He said the United States regarded agricultural goods and services as ''priority issues'' for new talks under the General Arrangement on Tariffs and Trade, the world body that regulates commerce. Trade ministers from more than 100 countries hope to begin such negotiations at a meeting in Punta del Este, Uruguay, that starts Sept. 15.","abstract":null,"print_page":"6","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"U.S. ISSUES THREAT IN TALKS ON TRADE"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"REAGAN, RONALD WILSON"},{"name":"glocations","value":"UNITED STATES"},{"name":"subject","value":"AGRICULTURE"},{"name":"subject","value":"INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND WORLD MARKET"},{"name":"subject","value":"TELECOMMUNICATIONS"},{"name":"subject","value":"BANKS AND BANKING"}],"pub_date":"1986-09-07T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Foreign Desk","section_name":"World","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Paul","rank":1,"lastname":"LEWIS"},{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":2}],"original":"By PAUL LEWIS, Special to the New York Times"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd165658eb7c8105d6529c8","word_count":844},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1986\/09\/07\/business\/business-forum-following-china-s-example-gorbachev-finds-an-ally-in-capitalism.html","snippet":"PARTLY stymied in his straightforward attempts to reform and modernize the Soviet economy, Mikhail Gorbachev has recently begun to unveil a backdoor strategy.

While still in its earliest stages, the plan seems to involve exposing Soviet enterprises to the international economy through joint ventures with Western companies and through greater Soviet participation in the international economic establishment. By exposing Soviet industry to the ways of the capitalist world, Mr. Gorbachev hopes to stimulate productivity growth and the speedier mastery of world technology. The new policy marks an abrupt break with the past. For years, Soviet authorities have attacked such institutions as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank as instruments of imperialist and American domination. Now, they have come around to acknowledging the occasional merit of these organizations and hinted that it might be nice if the Soviet Union were allowed to join. Specifically, the Russians have asked for observer status at the GATT meetings, which convene Sept. 15 at Punta del Este, Uruguay.","abstract":null,"print_page":"3","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"GORBACHEV FINDS AN ALLY IN CAPITALISM","kicker":"BUSINESS FORUM: FOLLOWING CHINA'S EXAMPLE?"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"UNION OF SOVIET SOCIALIST REPUBLICS"},{"name":"subject","value":"JOINT VENTURES AND CONSORTIUMS"},{"name":"subject","value":"REFORM AND REORGANIZATION"},{"name":"subject","value":"ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND TRENDS"}],"pub_date":"1986-09-07T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Financial Desk","section_name":"Business","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"firstname":"Marshall","middlename":"I.","lastname":"GOLDMAN","rank":1,"role":"reported","organization":""}],"original":"By MARSHALL I.

Yeutter announced here this weekend. After receiving assurances that the 12 European Community countries would ratify another pact giving American citrus fruit and almond growers improved access to their markets, the United States would begin putting into effect, on Sept. 15, the agreement governing imports of European semi-finished steel products worked out last July, Mr. Yeutter said. The Reagan Administration had refused to put into effect the steel agreement after indications that Italy was trying to sabotage the citrus and nut pact, which it believes could hurt its own farmers. But Mr. Yeutter said he is ''totally satisfied'' that the community would ratify the fruit pact ''within the next couple of weeks'' after talks here with European Community Commissioner Willie de Clercq, the chief European trade negotiator.","abstract":null,"print_page":"1","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"U.S., EUROPE TO SETTLE ON STEEL, CITRUS"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"REAGAN, RONALD WILSON"},{"name":"persons","value":"YEUTTER, CLAYTON K"},{"name":"glocations","value":"JAPAN"},{"name":"glocations","value":"EUROPE, WEST"},{"name":"glocations","value":"CANADA"},{"name":"glocations","value":"UNITED STATES"},{"name":"organizations","value":"EUROPEAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY"},{"name":"organizations","value":"GENERAL AGREEMENT ON TARIFFS AND TRADE"},{"name":"subject","value":"INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND WORLD MARKET"},{"name":"subject","value":"ALMONDS"},{"name":"subject","value":"CITRUS FRUITS"},{"name":"subject","value":"STEEL AND IRON"},{"name":"subject","value":"NUTS"}],"pub_date":"1986-09-08T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Financial Desk","section_name":"Business","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Paul","rank":1,"lastname":"LEWIS"},{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":2}],"original":"By PAUL LEWIS, Special to the New York Times"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd16bda8eb7c8105d65d5bd","word_count":801},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1986\/09\/08\/business\/dangerous-lengthening-of-latin-recession-seen.html","snippet":"Latin America's economic recession is ''lengthening dangerously,'' because of huge capital outflows to pay international debt, and will not be reversed until the resource drain is cut ''significantly,'' the Inter-American Development Bank said today....","lead_paragraph":"Latin America's economic recession is ''lengthening dangerously,'' because of huge capital outflows to pay international debt, and will not be reversed until the resource drain is cut ''significantly,'' the Inter-American Development Bank said today. In its annual report on ''Economic and Social Progress in Latin America,'' the Washington-based institution, one of the principal multilateral lenders to the region, placed the outflow to pay interest on the debt at nearly $100 billion since the start of the decade. This does not take into account what economists call nonrecorded capital transfers, otherwise known as capital flight, estimated at several times that amount.
