Gorbachev of the Soviet Union arrives this week in London to ask leaders at the economic summit conference for help with his sinking economy, his presence will stand as a dramatic symbol of the West's victory in the cold war. But even without Mr. Gorbachev, this year's assembly of the leaders of the seven most powerful industrial democracies would be of unusual significance. With nationalism and economic regionalism on the rise and the world economy practically at a standstill, the Western powers can lead the way toward closer integration and more stable and vigorous growth, helping to create conditions for an enduring peace. Or they can let the world economy stagnate and fracture into competing trade blocs, setting the stage for future national and regional conflicts.","abstract":null,"print_page":"1","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Trickle Down; At the Summit, A Chance to Set the Stage For Growth"},"keywords":[{"name":"organizations","value":"GROUP OF SEVEN"},{"name":"subject","value":"POPULATION"},{"name":"subject","value":"SUMMIT CONFERENCES"},{"name":"subject","value":"CREDIT"},{"name":"subject","value":"ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND TRENDS"},{"name":"subject","value":"THIRD WORLD AND DEVELOPING COUNTRIES"}],"pub_date":"1991-07-14T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Week In Review Desk","section_name":"Week in Review","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Leonard","rank":1,"lastname":"SILK"}],"original":"By LEONARD SILK"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd1ab238eb7c8105d6c9514","word_count":1574},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1991\/07\/15\/opinion\/no-fatal-distractions-in-london.html","snippet":"When Mikhail Gorbachev appears Wednesday at the end of the London summit meeting of Western leaders, will he commit himself to radical economic reform?

Will he seek Western aid, or just advice? And will he offer a specific economic program, or mere generalities? These are riveting questions. And therein lies a danger. As important as Mr. Gorbachev's visit is, it should not be allowed to distract the leaders of the seven major industrialized countries from some urgent unfinished business of their own. The Uruguay Round of international trade talks is stalled, and the G-7 leaders are mostly to blame.","abstract":null,"print_page":"14","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"No Fatal Distractions in London"},"keywords":[{"name":"subject","value":"TERMS NOT AVAILABLE"}],"pub_date":"1991-07-15T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Editorial Desk","section_name":"Opinion","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"Editorial","_id":"4fd1ab298eb7c8105d6c99f4","word_count":483},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1991\/07\/16\/science\/science-watch-infestation-by-worm-is-contained-in-africa.html","snippet":"A RAPIDLY growing, potentially catastrophic infestation by the New World screwworm in Libya has been contained by an emergency eradication effort, officials of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations say.

They responded mainly with wind. Trade issues were dutifully debated, but the Europeans had no intention of lowering trade barriers to benefit the international community, or even their own taxpayers, over a handful of farmers. And when Mikhail Gorbachev appeared, the leaders applauded but offered more words than dollars.

But they have turned into the annual meetings of the Board of Directors of the Planet Earth, where political and military questions often dominate, where reputations and alliances and friendships are formed, and where great policy questions are pushed up or down the international agenda. Which is, of course, why Mikhail S. Gorbachev wanted so badly to come here last week, even if it did expose him to derision as a Bolshevik beggar. Critics complain that the G-7 summit conferences have become too elephantine and elaborate (this year's spectacular was a mini-tattoo, complete with lasers, fireworks and bands, in the courtyard of Buckingham Palace). All the important decisions are made in advance, the critics say, and all the rough edges of real debate are smoothed away so the 3,000 or so journalists who now attend can concentrate on image-building for domestic politics.","abstract":null,"print_page":"1","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"The Grown-Ups; A Few Drinks, a Few Laughs, A Few Momentous Decisions"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"BUSH, GEORGE"},{"name":"persons","value":"GORBACHEV, MIKHAIL S"},{"name":"glocations","value":"EUROPE"},{"name":"glocations","value":"UNION OF SOVIET SOCIALIST REPUBLICS"},{"name":"subject","value":"UNITED STATES INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS"},{"name":"subject","value":"INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS"},{"name":"subject","value":"ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND TRENDS"},{"name":"subject","value":"FOREIGN AID"}],"pub_date":"1991-07-21T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Week In Review Desk","section_name":"Washington; Week in Review","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"qualifier":"Jr","firstname":"R.","middlename":"W.","lastname":"APPLE","rank":1,"role":"reported","organization":""}],"original":"By R.
