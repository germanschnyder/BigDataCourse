A report from the Federal Reserve showed that labor shortages have not translated into rising consumer or industrial prices. Both are further evidence of slower growth that will keep inflation in check and give the Fed little reason to raise interest rates. $(Page D3.$)","abstract":null,"print_page":"1","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"BUSINESS DIGEST"},"keywords":[],"pub_date":"1997-09-18T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Business\/Financial Desk","section_name":"Business","subsection_name":null,"byline":null,"type_of_material":"Summary","_id":"4fd2119e8eb7c8105d78734b","word_count":533},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1997\/09\/27\/theater\/how-to-be-a-hit-a-whodunit-has-the-solution.html","snippet":"The biggest attraction in the history of the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, a place usually associated with symphony, ballet and opera, is a freewheeling, audience-participation comedy about a murder in a beauty parlor.

''Shear Madness,'' which celebrated its 10th anniversary this week, has been seen here by nearly 1.5 million people. It is Washington's longest-running play. In Boston, ''Shear Madness'' has been running almost 18 years, and it has just had its 15th anniversary in Chicago. Most things went as usual at the 10th-anniversary show on Thursday night. A murder was committed offstage: someone killed the concert pianist who lived above the beauty salon. The audience, invited to play whodunit, shouted opinions about the suspects' alibis to the detectives investigating the crime. But after the murder had been solved by vote of the audience and curtain calls had been taken, a brief ceremony was held to mark the 10-year milestone. The actor Dwayne Hickman, who played Dobie Gillis in the television series, came onstage and presented Lucite plaques representing the Charlie Chaplin Comedy Award to the play's co-producers, co-creators and original co-stars, Bruce Jordan and Marilyn Abrams.","abstract":"Shear Madness, comedy about murder in a beauty parlor, celebrates its 10th anniversary this week in Washington; it has been running in Boston for almost 18 years, and has just had its 15th anniversary in Chicago; Bruce Jordan and Marilyn Abrams, its producers, are opening in several foreign cities in near future; say they may seek to open in New York City at some point; photo (M)","print_page":"8","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"How to Be a Hit?
