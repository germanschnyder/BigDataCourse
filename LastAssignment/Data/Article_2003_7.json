The good news is that there are many fine alternatives, and that international regulations are increasingly effective in guaranteeing the quality and authenticity of what is sold. This year, red tape has held up the shipping of Russian caviar, and it could take weeks before any of it shows up in American stores. The Russian caviar that is for sale here is, at best, from the 2002 catch. But some of the caviar labeled Russian is actually from Kazakhstan, on the Caspian Sea. Most of that caviar is also from 2002.","abstract":"Fresh Russian caviar from 2003 catch is all but impossible to find in New York this year, but there are many fine alternatives; international regulations are increasingly effective in guaranteeing quality and authenticity of what is sold (M)","print_page":"5","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Casting for Caviar, in the Caspian and Beyond"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"RUSSIA"},{"name":"subject","value":"CAVIAR"},{"name":"subject","value":"FISH AND OTHER MARINE LIFE"}],"pub_date":"2003-12-24T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Dining In, Dining Out\/Style Desk","section_name":"Dining and Wine; Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Florence","rank":1,"lastname":"FABRICANT"}],"original":"By FLORENCE FABRICANT"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd235d78eb7c8105d7c7a68","word_count":686},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2003\/12\/27\/us\/mad-cow-disease-united-states-exports-brazil-argentina-expect-rising-beef-sales.html","snippet":"The emergence of a case of mad cow disease in the United States this week has created an unparalleled opportunity for Brazil and Argentina, two of the main competitors of the United States in the booming international beef export market, to capture...","lead_paragraph":"The emergence of a case of mad cow disease in the United States this week has created an unparalleled opportunity for Brazil and Argentina, two of the main competitors of the United States in the booming international beef export market, to capture new customers, government and industry officials here say.
