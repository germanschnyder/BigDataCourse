But, five years into his tenure as chief executive officer of the Caramoor International Music Festival in Katonah, N.Y., that's precisely what he has done.

In its 63rd season, which opens on Saturday, nearly a third of the 38 concerts will deviate in some way from that formula. And the audiences will be about 15 percent larger than they were before he took over, he said.","abstract":null,"print_page":"1","blog":[],"source":"The New York
