The sale, which would be one of the biggest of its kind in 20 years, should bring the Government a profit of at least $250 million, officials said. The Government received the warrants as part of the loan guarantee accord that saved the company from bankruptcy three years ago. (Page 1.) Du Pont earnings rose 9.7 percent for the second quarter.

With a bogey at each of the last two holes ''because I was choking and so nervous,'' Miss Stephenson shot three- over-par 74 in the final round at Cedar Ridge Country Club for a 72-hole score of six-over 290, the highest winning score in an Open in six years.

Which was which? ''We had a hard time fighting over which one of us was going to be the Ugly,'' Mr. Colon recalled the other day. Since the covers of Mr. Colon's early salsa albums depicted him as ''El Malo,'' a street-hoodlum type, he was obviously ''the Bad.'' The rotund, good-humored Mr. Toro, a virtuoso of the 10-string guitarlike instrument known as the cuatro, had recently enjoyed commercial success with an album of Christmas songs played and sung in an updated version of the traditional Puerto Rican jibaro or hill-country style. He could only be ''the Good.'' That left Mr. Lavoe, whose soulful, mellifluous vocals and Latin-lover looks had made him the heartthrob of Latin music, to play ''the Ugly.''","abstract":null,"print_page":"17","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"COLON, LAVOE AND TORO WITH VARIATIONS ON SALASA"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"COLON, WILLIE"},{"name":"persons","value":"TORO, YOMO"},{"name":"persons","value":"LAVOE, HECTOR"},{"name":"subject","value":"MUSIC"},{"name":"subject","value":"CONCERTS AND RECITALS"}],"pub_date":"1983-08-05T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Weekend Desk","section_name":"Arts","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Robert","rank":1,"lastname":"PALMER"}],"original":"By ROBERT PALMER"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd1350f8eb7c8105d605a18","word_count":917},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1983\/08\/08\/world\/around-the-world-uruguay-police-arrest-150-demonstrators.html","snippet":"The police arrested about 150 people during Saturday night's demonstrations against Uruguay's military Government, police sources said today.","lead_paragraph":"The police arrested about 150 people during Saturday night's demonstrations against Uruguay's military Government, police sources said today.","abstract":null,"print_page":"5","blog":[],"source":"Reuters","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Uruguay Police Arrest 150 Demonstrators","kicker":"AROUND THE WORLD"},"keywords":[{"name":"subject","value":"TERMS NOT AVAILABLE"}],"pub_date":"1983-08-08T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Foreign Desk","section_name":"World","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[],"original":"Reuters","organization":"Reuters"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd13a598eb7c8105d60f367","word_count":"68"},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1983\/08\/21\/world\/around-the-world-argentine-nobel-winner-is-barred-by-uruguay.html","snippet":"Adolfo Perez Esquivel, the Argentine Nobel Peace Prize winner, was denied entry to Uruguay by the military Government today, police sources said.","lead_paragraph":"Adolfo Perez Esquivel, the Argentine Nobel Peace Prize winner, was denied entry to Uruguay by the military Government today, police sources said.","abstract":null,"print_page":"5","blog":[],"source":"Reuters","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Argentine Nobel Winner Is Barred by Uruguay","kicker":"AROUND THE WORLD"},"keywords":[{"name":"subject","value":"TERMS NOT AVAILABLE"}],"pub_date":"1983-08-21T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Foreign Desk","section_name":"World","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[],"original":"Reuters","organization":"Reuters"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"52b8510138f0d8094087baee","word_count":"117"}]},"status":"OK","copyright":"Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
