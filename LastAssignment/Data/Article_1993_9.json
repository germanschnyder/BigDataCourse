Eccentricities of distribution matter little, however, given the strength and variety of the work on view. The artists range in age from 30 to 76 and offer a wide spectrum of media and styles, from the photographed site-pieces of the Cuban-born Ana Mendieta (1948-1985), to the surrealist images of the Mexican painter Francisco Toledo, to the politically pointed video installation by the Chilean artist Jose Antonio Hernandez-Diez While an interest in polemic runs through the show, it is the sense of a deep but conflicted spirituality that distinguishes the work in \"Ante America\" from much contemporary art being made in New York.","abstract":null,"print_page":"25","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Review\/Art; A Multi-National Approach to Characterizing the Americas"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"LATIN AMERICA"},{"name":"organizations","value":"QUEENS MUSEUM OF ART"},{"name":"subject","value":"REVIEWS"},{"name":"subject","value":"ART SHOWS"},{"name":"subject","value":"ART"}],"pub_date":"1993-08-20T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Weekend Desk","section_name":"Arts","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Holland","rank":1,"lastname":"COTTER"}],"original":"By HOLLAND COTTER"},"type_of_material":"Review","_id":"4fd1bb2c8eb7c8105d6e5cc7","word_count":873},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1993\/08\/23\/sports\/soccer-brazil-and-argentina-keep-pace-in-qualifying.html","snippet":"Brazil 2, Ecuador 0   In Sao Paulo, Brazil, Bebeto scored once in the first half and set up Dunga for another goal in the second before a crowd of 80,000.

With a defense that didn't require goalkeeper Claudio Taffarel to make any saves, Brazil improved to 2-2-1, ahead of Ecuador and Uruguay in the race for the second in Group B. Two teams will qualify for the World Cup finals from the group, which Bolivia now leads with 10 points. Argentina 2, Peru 1 In Buenos Aires, Gabriel Batistuta and Ramon Medina Bello scored five minutes apart in the first half to lead Argentina. The victory improved Argentina to 3-0-1 and 6 points, the same as Colombia (2-2-2) in Group A. The winner of the group qualifies for the World Cup finals while the runner-up will play against Australia in a playoff. Paraguay 1, Colombia 1 In Asuncion, Paraguay, Catalino Rivarola scored in the 55th minute to rally Paraguay and keep its hopes alive. Freddy Rincon gave Colombia the lead in the 23d minute in a match played in light rain. Paraguay improved to 1-1-2 with 4 points, 2 behind Argentina and Colombia. Sweden 1, France 1 In Stockholm, Martin Dahlin scored with two minutes left to salvage the draw for Sweden. Frank Sauzee had put France ahead in the 75th minute on a close-range shot.
