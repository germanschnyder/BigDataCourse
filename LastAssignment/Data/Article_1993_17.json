Although trade officials reported progress on several issues in the negotiations among 116 nations, two meetings on Sunday between Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, and the European Community's chief trade official, Sir Leon Brittan, failed to resolve a deadlock over the export of American movies. This left the fate of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade talks uncertain with three days remaining until an agreed-upon Wednesday deadline.","abstract":null,"print_page":"1","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Film Issue Snags Trade Talks; Anti-Dumping Pact Reached"},"keywords":[{"name":"creative_works","value":"GENERAL AGREEMENT ON TARIFFS AND TRADE (GATT)"},{"name":"glocations","value":"FRANCE"},{"name":"glocations","value":"UNITED STATES"},{"name":"organizations","value":"GENERAL AGREEMENT ON TARIFFS AND TRADE"},{"name":"subject","value":"MOTION PICTURES"},{"name":"subject","value":"INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND WORLD MARKET"},{"name":"subject","value":"TELEVISION"},{"name":"subject","value":"CUSTOMS (TARIFF)"},{"name":"subject","value":"DUMPING (TRADE TERM)"}],"pub_date":"1993-12-13T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Financial Desk","section_name":"Movies; Front Page; Business","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Roger","rank":1,"lastname":"COHEN"}],"original":"By ROGER COHEN"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd1ea808eb7c8105d739fe8","word_count":1226},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1993\/12\/13\/opinion\/editorial-notebook-high-noon-at-uruguay-gulch.html","snippet":"Predictably, France has been cast as the foot-dragging heavy as the complex trade negotiations known as the Uruguay Round stumble to a finale.
