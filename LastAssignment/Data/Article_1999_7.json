Still, he and the player representatives for the 29 teams agree that with the N.B.A. soon to begin testing for marijuana, it is time to educate the masses. During the union's annual meetings in the Bahamas last week, representatives were told to spread the word to their teammates about the league's new drug policy. Since marijuana can stay in a person's system for two to three months, players who use it in July run a risk of being caught in October.","abstract":"Basketball Notebook article focuses on National Basketball Players Association plan to alert players to league's new drug policy, which includes testing for marijuana; photo (M)","print_page":"9","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Union Alerts Players to Treat the New N.B.A. Drug Policy Seriously","kicker":"PRO BASKETBALL: NOTEBOOK"},"keywords":[{"name":"organizations","value":"NATIONAL BASKETBALL PLAYERS ASSN"},{"name":"organizations","value":"NATIONAL BASKETBALL ASSN"},{"name":"subject","value":"TESTS AND TESTING"},{"name":"subject","value":"BASKETBALL"},{"name":"subject","value":"DRUG ABUSE AND TRAFFIC"},{"name":"subject","value":"MARIJUANA"}],"pub_date":"1999-07-11T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Sports Desk","section_name":"Sports","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Mike","rank":1,"lastname":"WISE"}],"original":"By MIKE WISE"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd226a38eb7c8105d7aef6b","word_count":1618},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1999\/07\/12\/sports\/plus-nba-indiana-jackson-to-play-on-dominican-team.html","snippet":"Mark Jackson of the Indiana Pacers will join the Dominican Republic's national team in a pre-Olympic tournament in Puerto Rico this week, Dominican officials said yesterday.

But before the world's best player could finish the play with a short, smooth bank shot, he was leveled by the Canadian center, Todd MacCulloch, and sent to the floor, clutching his left heel. As Duncan laid on the court for several minutes, the Team USA coach, Larry Brown, imagined something horrible. ''When he went down, I was. . . .'' said Brown, never completing his sentence.
