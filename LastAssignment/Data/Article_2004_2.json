But imports from Argentina were banned because of hoof-and-mouth disease, and the owners, Anastasios Hairatidis and Medhat Ibrahim, settled for Australian. Then something better came along. ''I found out that beef from Uruguay, right next door to Argentina, was approved,'' Mr. Hairatidis said. ''It's really the same as the beef from Argentina.'' He said his customers order Uruguayan filet mignon and strip loins twice as often as American prime. The lean Uruguayan strip loin, bottom, is a trifle chewy but it has an exceptionally beefy taste, and the flavorful filet, top, is very tender. The restaurant, at 339 East 75th Street, sells the meat by the ounce, $1.85 for the strip, $2.55 for the filet.","abstract":"Hacienda de Argentina on Upper East Side is serving beef from Uruguay because Argentine beef has been banned because of hoof-and-mouth disease; photo (S)","print_page":"2","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"The Beef Less Marbled","kicker":"FOOD STUFF"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"URUGUAY"},{"name":"glocations","value":"ARGENTINA"},{"name":"organizations","value":"HACIENDA DE ARGENTINA"},{"name":"subject","value":"LIVESTOCK"},{"name":"subject","value":"RESTAURANTS"},{"name":"subject","value":"FOOT-AND-MOUTH DISEASE"}],"pub_date":"2004-04-21T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Dining In, Dining Out\/Style Desk","section_name":"Dining and Wine; Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Florence","rank":1,"lastname":"Fabricant"}],"original":"By Florence Fabricant"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd29f688eb7c8105d883189","word_count":165},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2004\/04\/22\/world\/latin-america-losing-hope-in-democracy-report-says.html","snippet":"A majority of Latin Americans say they would support the replacement of a democratic government with an ''authoritarian'' one if it could produce economic benefits, according to a United Nations report released Wednesday in Lima, Peru.

Instead, the new accord, signed in January, has reignited a sometimes anguished debate here about what it means to be Latin American and whether Chile has somehow lost those essential characteristics. Since the beginning of the decade, all three of Chile's neighbors have suffered political and economic convulsions that have forced changes of government.
