A report by the five-member agency said that the other countries named in complaints it had examined were Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Cyprus, El Salvador, Ethiopia, Guatemala, Indonesia, Mexico, Nicaragua, Peru, the Philippines, South Africa and Uruguay. The panel, appointed a year ago by the world organization's Human Rights Commission to examine the problem of missing persons said that the information it had studied \"warrants the deepest concern both for the danger to the life, liberty and physical security of the disappeared persons and for the anguish and sorrow caused to their relatives.\"","abstract":null,"print_page":"5","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Around the World; U.N.

They had failed to injure the armed forces or to spark a nationwide strike and popular insurrection, but the rebels seemed no closer to surrender. The leftist forces withdrew to the mountains and began regrouping. If they fail in their next push, their leaders said privately, they hope at least to win a place at the bargaining table. And if there are no negotiations, they will revert to ''prolonged popular war.'' Washington seemed to agree that the guerrillas remain a threat. It renewed military aid to the junta last month, arguing that the guerrillas were receiving arms from Cuba and Nicaragua. For the first time in three years, the United States sent ''lethal'' equipment, notably helicopter gunships and automatic rifles for the expanding army. A small cadre of American advisers was also on the scene.","abstract":null,"print_page":"4","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"SALVADOR GUERILLAS HAVE NEITHER WON-NOR LOST"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"SALVADOR, EL"},{"name":"subject","value":"POLITICS AND GOVERNMENT"},{"name":"subject","value":"TERRORISM"}],"pub_date":"1981-02-08T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Week in Review Desk","section_name":"Week in Review","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Alan","rank":1,"lastname":"RIDING"}],"original":"By ALAN RIDING"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd116858eb7c8105d5cda91","word_count":1027},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1981\/02\/08\/magazine\/thunder-from-the-right.html","snippet":"OPENER Peter Ross Range is a freelance writer based in Washington.

Even the Reagan Administration's fears of Cuban expansionism in Central America have found little echo among key countries of the hemisphere, which are now more concerned with problems of their own economic development. Latin America has changed dramatically since the 1960's, when it accepted Washington's political leadership much more readily. Today it puts its own interests before those of the United States. Brazil, Argentina, Mexico and Venezuela, in particular, have emerged as regional powers with their own spheres of influence, as quick to clash with Washington over economic issues as they are to defend their new political prestige. Social Structures Challenged Even in the tiny, dependent countries of Central America, leftists and liberals have begun challenging near-feudal social structures long sustained by the United States. Throughout the Caribbean basin, Washington is now competing for influence not only with Cuba, but also with Mexico, Venezuela and the European Social Democratic and Christian Democratic movements.","abstract":null,"print_page":"8","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"News Analysis; REAGAN AND THE LATINS; Foreign Policy Third in a series of occasional articles on international problems facing the Reagan Administration."},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"REAGAN, RONALD WILSON"},{"name":"persons","value":"CARTER, JIMMY"},{"name":"glocations","value":"VENEZUELA"},{"name":"glocations","value":"PANAMA"},{"name":"glocations","value":"UNION OF SOVIET SOCIALIST REPUBLICS"},{"name":"glocations","value":"ARGENTINA"},{"name":"glocations","value":"SALVADOR, EL"},{"name":"glocations","value":"NICARAGUA"},{"name":"glocations","value":"CENTRAL AMERICA"},{"name":"glocations","value":"COLOMBIA"},{"name":"glocations","value":"CHILE"},{"name":"glocations","value":"CARIBBEAN AREA"},{"name":"glocations","value":"CUBA"},{"name":"glocations","value":"BRAZIL"},{"name":"glocations","value":"UNITED STATES"},{"name":"glocations","value":"DOMINICAN REPUBLIC"},{"name":"glocations","value":"URUGUAY"},{"name":"glocations","value":"MEXICO"},{"name":"glocations","value":"PERU"},{"name":"subject","value":"VIETNAM WAR"},{"name":"subject","value":"ARMAMENT, DEFENSE AND MILITARY FORCES"},{"name":"subject","value":"INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS"},{"name":"subject","value":"UNITED STATES POLITICS AND GOVERNMENT"},{"name":"subject","value":"ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH"},{"name":"subject","value":"POLITICS AND GOVERNMENT"},{"name":"subject","value":"UNITED STATE INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS"},{"name":"subject","value":"THIRD WORLD AND DEVELOPING COUNTRIES"},{"name":"subject","value":"MILITARY PERSONNEL"},{"name":"subject","value":"MILITARY ACTION"},{"name":"subject","value":"UNITED STATES ARMAMENT AND DEFENSE"}],"pub_date":"1981-02-13T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Foreign Desk","section_name":"World; Washington","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Alan","rank":1,"lastname":"RIDING"},{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":2}],"original":"By ALAN RIDING, Special to the New York Times"},"type_of_material":"An Analysis","_id":"4fd10ce18eb7c8105d5c1054","word_count":1406},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1981\/02\/15\/sports\/south-america-rises-in-soccer.html","snippet":"The World Cup tournament is still 16 months away, but it is becoming increasingly evident that the South Americans will have the edge when the premier soccer event in the world is played in Madrid in July 1982.

Italy, the Netherlands and West Germany have been the main powers in Europe in recent years, but all three failed to win a game in the Gold World Cup tournament last month in Montevideo, Uruguay. Czechoslovakia and Belgium, two other national powers, are currently struggling in qualifying games, as is the Soviet Union, which has been struggling since the 1970 event. The South Americans' strength was shown in the Gold World Cup when Uruguay and Brazil gained the final, with Uruguay winning by 2-1. Further evidence was provided in Tokyo last Tuesday night in a game that represented the world championship for club teams. Nacional of Uruguay defeated Nottingham Forest of England, 1-0. Nottingham Forest represented Europe because it won the European Cup, and Nacional represented South America as the holder of the Liberators Cup, emblematic of South American supremacy at the club level.","abstract":null,"print_page":"7","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"South America Rises in Soccer"},"keywords":[{"name":"subject","value":"SOCCER"},{"name":"subject","value":"PROFESSIONAL ATHLETICS"}],"pub_date":"1981-02-15T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Sports Desk","section_name":"Sports","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Alex","rank":1,"lastname":"YANNIS"}],"original":"By ALEX YANNIS"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd117058eb7c8105d5ce173","word_count":782},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1981\/02\/19\/us\/around-the-nation-deportation-trial-defendant-identified-with-nazi-camp.html","snippet":"An elderly Jewish survivor of the Holocaust recalled today that a Ukrainian named Ivan was ''the biggest devil'' among the guards he knew at the Nazi death camp in Poland called Treblinka.
