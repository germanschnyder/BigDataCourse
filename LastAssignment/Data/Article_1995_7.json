A jazz musician and immigrant from Brazil, he wanted to be as close to Latin America as he could get during the America Cup soccer tournament that ends today. His destination: Jackson Heights. In a neighborhood that has become a crossroads of a diverse range of Latin American social clubs and discotecas -- where Uruguayan bars abut Ecuadoran, Argentine and Chilean restaurants -- Mr. Perelman settled into a Colombian restaurant called Chibcha on Roosevelt Avenue. As he watched the United States-Brazil game on Thursday night, he seemed to inhale the fervor of the other patrons, fellow Latin American immigrants.","abstract":null,"print_page":"29","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Passions Loosed In Queens For Soccer"},"keywords":[{"name":"glocations","value":"NEW YORK CITY"},{"name":"subject","value":"SOCCER"},{"name":"subject","value":"TELEVISION"},{"name":"subject","value":"SPANISH-SPEAKING GROUPS (US)"},{"name":"subject","value":"AMERICA CUP (SOCCER)"}],"pub_date":"1995-07-23T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Metropolitan Desk","section_name":"New York and Region","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Raymond","rank":1,"lastname":"HERNANDEZ"}],"original":"By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd2004d8eb7c8105d76339b","word_count":991},{"web_url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1995\/07\/24\/sports\/uruguay-wins-america-cup.html","snippet":"Uruguay, looking to reassert itself after missing the 1994 World Cup, beat Brazil, 5-3, on penalty kicks today to win the America Cup.

The Great Lawn of the park, in contrast, looked like a war zone, evidently denuded by the Disney screenings of \"Pocahontas\" last month. Dirt loomed as far as the eye could see; if any scraps of grass remained, they must have been under the blankets of early arrivals. Yet here, hunkering in the grit and sweltering in beastly heat and humidity, were 50,000 New Yorkers, by official estimates, some of them actually listening to the music. An un likelier setting for the ethereal strains of Richard Strauss's \"Rosenkavalier\" could hardly be imagined.","abstract":null,"print_page":"12","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Ethereal Phrases on a Gritty Plain","kicker":"MUSIC REVIEW"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"BEN-DOR, GISELE"},{"name":"glocations","value":"CENTRAL PARK (NYC)"},{"name":"organizations","value":"NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC"},{"name":"subject","value":"MUSIC"},{"name":"subject","value":"REVIEWS"}],"pub_date":"1995-07-27T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Cultural Desk","section_name":"Arts","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"firstname":"James","middlename":"R.","lastname":"OESTREICH","rank":1,"role":"reported","organization":""}],"original":"By JAMES R.

At the recent America Cup tournament in Uruguay, Argentine fans belittled their Chilean counterparts as \"sons of Pinochet\" (translation: Chile is full of militarists).
