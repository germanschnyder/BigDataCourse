It plunged spectators clustered around television screens in homes and boulevard cafes into grief and immense Gallic shrugs. But, ultimately, said one French student who watched his national team's exit from the World Cup on his computer screen here today, it was ''the story of a death foretold.'' France, the world soccer champion, had lost 2-0 to lowly Denmark. France, the team held in thrall by the star player Zinedine Zidane, was out.
