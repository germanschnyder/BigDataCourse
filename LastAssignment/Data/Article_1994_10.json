But this breach of the budget is not considered a major problem by Government leaders in Washington because the new GATT agreement will be a bonanza for big business, and that is something favored by Democrats and Republicans alike. When benefits for working people or the poor are involved, the budget deficit is seen as an insurmountable problem. There is no money for investments in ordinary Americans.
